# Purple Dragon Knight
*Prestige Class*  
*Player's Guide to Faerun v3.5, p.68*

*The famed Purple Dragons make up the bulk of Cormyr’s standing army. These highly trained soldiers, coupled with the fearsome War Wizards of Cormyr, have defended the Forest Kingdom from all manner of threats, from savage humanoids to the mysterious shades. The Purple Dragon knight, one of the army’s high-ranking officers, can command from ten to a hundred or more soldiers on the battlefield. Being awarded the rank of Purple Dragon knight is a great honor for any Cormyrian.*  
*Fighters, rangers, and paladins make up the majority of the Purple Dragon knights, but a few are bards, clerics, or rogues. Sorcerers and wizards, while not outright forbidden from joining the Purple Dragons, almost always join the War Wizards, Cormyr’s elite brigade of combat-trained spellcasters, instead. Barbarians, druids, and monks seldom join the ranks of the Purple Dragon knights, being either too undisciplined or too uncivilized.*  
*Having levels in this prestige class implies at least a nominal degree o f military service in Cormyr, and thus the class might not be appropriate for all campaigns.*

## Class Features

### Level 1: Heroic Shield
On your turn, you can take the Help action as a Bonus Action. When you take the Help action, you can choose the following option for its effect.  
***Protect an Ally.*** When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can protect that creature. Until the start of your next turn or until you are no longer within 5 feet of it, that creature gains a bonus to AC equal to your Proficiency Bonus.  

### Level 1: Rallying Cry
As a Bonus Action or when you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can choose a number of allies equal to your Purple Dragon Knight level that are within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you. You and your chosen allies gain the following benefits.  
Until the start of your next turn, your Speed increases by 10 feet and you gain a bonus to attack rolls equal to your Proficiency Bonus.  
You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
When you reach certain Purple Dragon Knight levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Rallying Cry column of the Purple Dragon Knight Features table.  

### Level 2: Inspire Courage
You can make an inspirational speech to bolster your allies against mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 60 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled. The new roll has Advantage and a bonus equal to your Purple Dragon Knight level.  

### Level 3: Fear
As a Bonus Action, you can evoke fear into others. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  

### Level 4: Oath of Wrath
When you take the Attack action, you may swear to defeat a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You gain a bonus equal to your Purple Dragon Knight level on attack and damage rolls against the creature as well as on saving throws that the creature forces you to make for 1 minute.  
If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the oath ends, you can transfer the oath to a different creature within 60 feet of yourself (no action required).  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.  

### Level 5: Final Stand
You can inspire your allies to a heroic effort. As a Bonus Action or when you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can choose a number of allies equal to your Purple Dragon Knight level that are within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you. You and your chosen allies regain Hit Points equal to 2d10 plus your Purple Dragon Knight level.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
