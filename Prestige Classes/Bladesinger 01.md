# Bladesinger 01

*Complete Warrior, pg.17*

*Bladesingers are elves who have blended art, swordplay, and arcane magic into a harmonious whole. In battle, a bladesingerâ€™s lithe movements and subtle tactics are beautiful, belying their deadly martial efficiency.*  
*Multiclass fighter/wizards are the most obvious candidates for the prestige class, although any elf who can wield a martial weapon and cast arcane spells can become a bladesinger. Bladesinger ranger/wizards, rogue/wizards, and even bards are not unknown.*  
*Bladesingers command great respect in most elf communities, and NPC bladesingers usually serve as itinerant guardians and champions of the elf community at large.*
