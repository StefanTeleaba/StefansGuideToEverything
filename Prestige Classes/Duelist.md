# Duelist
*Prestige Class*  
*Dungeon Master's Guide v3.5, p.185*

*The duelist (sometimes known as the swashbuckler) is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier. She always takes full advantage of her quick reflexes and wits in a fight. Rather than wearing bulky armor, a duelist feels the best way to protect herself is not to get hit at all.*  
*Duelists are most often fighters or rangers, but almost as often are rogues or bards. Wizards, sorcerers, and monks make surprisingly good duelists due to those classesâ€™ lack of reliance on armor. They benefit greatly from the weapon skill the duelist offers. Some paladins and barbarians who deviate a good deal from their archetypes become duelists.*  
*NPC duelists are usually loners looking for adventure or a getrich-quick scheme. Occasionally they work in small, tight-knit groups, fighting with team-based tactics.*
