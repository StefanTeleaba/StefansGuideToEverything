# Duelist
*Variant*  
*Prestige Class*  
*Dungeon Master's Guide v3.5, p.185*

*The duelist (sometimes known as the swashbuckler) is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier. She always takes full advantage of her quick reflexes and wits in a fight. Rather than wearing bulky armor, a duelist feels the best way to protect herself is not to get hit at all.*  
*Duelists are most often fighters or rangers, but almost as often are rogues or bards. Wizards, sorcerers, and monks make surprisingly good duelists due to those classes’ lack of reliance on armor. They benefit greatly from the weapon skill the duelist offers. Some paladins and barbarians who deviate a good deal from their archetypes become duelists.*  
*NPC duelists are usually loners looking for adventure or a getrich-quick scheme. Occasionally they work in small, tight-knit groups, fighting with team-based tactics.*

## Level 1: Improved Reaction
When you roll Initiative, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

## Level 2: Enhanced Mobility
While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your movement does not provoke Opportunity Attacks.

## Level 2: Grace
While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your Dexterity saving throws.

## Level 3: Acrobatic Charge
Difficult Terrain doesn't cost you extra movement and when you take the Dash action, your Speed increases by 10 feet for that action.

## Level 3: Precise Strike
While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, when you hit a target with an attack roll using a Finesse weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon. This damage increases to 2d6 when you reach Duelist level 5.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 5: Deflect Projectiles
