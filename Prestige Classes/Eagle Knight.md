# Eagle Knight
*Prestige Class*  
*Dragon Magazine 315, p.96*  

*Eagle knights are associated with the temple of Qotal, god of the sky. Although this temple is opposed to that of the jaguar knights in philosophy, the two knightly orders are generally friendly. To the knights, nationality is more important than religion.*

## Class Features

### Level 1: Druid Spells
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You can prepare a number of first level Druid spells equal to your Eagle Knight level. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.  
Starting at 5th level, you can prepare second level Druid spells.  
Starting at 9th level, you can prepare third level Druid spells.  
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

### Level 1: Eagle Form
The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an Eagle as a Bonus Action. You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to your Eagle Knight level or until you have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.  
***Number of Uses.*** You can use Eagle Form twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
You gain additional uses when you reach certain Eagle Knight levels, as shown in the Eagle Form column of the Eagle Knight Features table.  
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Eagle Form left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).  
#3## Eagle Form
| Eagle Knight Level | Known Forms |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 1                  | Eagle       |
| 5                  | Giant Eagle |

***Rules While Transformed.*** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:  
**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume an Eagle Form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to three times your Eagle Knight level.  
**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.  
**No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.  
**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.

### Level 2: Fast Movement
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.

### Level 4: Eagle Eyes
You gain a bonus to wisdom (Perception) checks equal to your Eagle Knight level.

### Level 6: Spell Resistance
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells.

### Level 8: Swoop
Your movement does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.
