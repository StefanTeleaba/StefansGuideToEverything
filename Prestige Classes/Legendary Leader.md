# Legendary Leader
*Heroes of Battle v3.5, p.107*

"Hold your lance up, keep your shield steady, and follow me to victory!"  
-Henrik Yensen, of Henrik's Horseriders

Legendary leaders are the stuff of bards' tales come to life. Their heroic exploit's bring followers to their side, and they create groups that embody their ideals. Members of this class represent not only the knight in shining armor atop the battlefield hill but also the cunning prince of thieves leading his own guild and the swashbuckling privateer captain with his hand-picked crew. Legendary leaders recruit like-minded individuals to their cause and become familiar with the politics and intrigue of running a small organization.

**Becoming a Legendary Leader**  
Any character with an above-average Charisma score can enter the legendary leader prestige class at 7th level if he has taken the leadership feat at 6th !eve!. A high Charisma increases a character's Leadership score, allowing him to recruit even more followers; hence, bard is an effective entry path for becoroing a legendary leader. Paladins and fighters also make good legendary leaders, gaining a significant number of benefits for the sacrifice of a bit of base attack bonus. Rogues are effective as well when focused on interacrion skills such as Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive, bur their ability to get past locks and traps will suffer (spending skill poinrs cross-class mitigates the problem). A member of the marshal class (from the Miniatures Handbook) also makes a fine legendary leader. Few spellcasters enter the class; the sacrifice of spell progression is seen as too high a cost for most, even though sorcerers make excellent leaders.  
Charisma (for interpersonal skills and Leadership score) is a key ability for the class, but the other high ability scores a legendary leader could have depends on the type of leader the character is best suited to be: the mighty warrior, the plotting master spy, the outgoing bard, and the wise mentor are all examples of legendary leaders.
