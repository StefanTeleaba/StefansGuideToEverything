# Avenging Executioner
*Variant*  
*Prestige Class*  
*Complete Scoundrel v3.5, p.24*

*“Scream. Scream like you made me scream.” - Peck, the Swan Street Slicer*  
*In the broken hearts and shattered dreams of the tragically wronged, seeds of vengeance take root. Avenging executioners are victims pushed past the limits of endurance who hunt sentient creatures out of a need for justice. Relentless and inventive, these stalkers wield psychology as deftly as their weapons. The fear they inspire can be even more deadly then their rusted blades.*  
*Hatred so intense as to be obsession inspires an avenging executioner to take up his bloody path. Rangers who have suffered mind-shattering tragedies might be compelled to choose fellow humanoids as their favored enemies. Rogues who turn to the path of vengeance use their lethal precision to dreadful effect. Druids who have seen their lands despoiled and sorcerers or wizards who have been victims of witch hunts might turn their spells toward revenge. Any individual so driven can excel as an avenging executioner, regardless of class.*  
*Hardened and tenacious, you use surprise and dread to weaken the subjects of your hatred.*

**Prerequisites**
- *Proficiency in the Intimidation skill*
- *Proficiency in the Stealth skill*

**Core Traits**
- **Hit Point Die:** D8 per Avenging Executioner level

## Level 1: Improved Intimidation
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can attempt to frighten the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.  
In addition, you gain a bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) checks equal to your Avenging Executioner level.

## Level 1: Sneak Attack
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.  
You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.  
The extra damage increases as you gain Avenging Executioner levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Avenging Executioner Features table.

## Level 2: Dread Blade
You have Advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have the Frightened condition.

## Level 3: Bloody Blade
You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt.  
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
***Terrify (Cost: 1d6).*** The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it has the Frightened condition for 1 minute.  
The Frightened target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 5: Bloody Murder
Immediately after you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, you can choose to strike terror into others. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
