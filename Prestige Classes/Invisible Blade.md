# Invisible Blade
*Variant*  
*Prestige Class*  
*Complete Warrior v3.5, p.44*

*Who is this fool who dares to challenge you in the arena? You brandish a greatsword, and he whips out a dagger. You unsheathe your longsword, and he throws off his armor. You advance menacingly, and he only smiles at you—a big, maniacal grin. Is he mad? Does he have a death wish? No, he is an invisible blade, and you have made the classic mistake of underestimating his prowess. As you fight, he seems almost relaxed, stepping lightly to the side, dodging your blows easily. His eyes note your every move, as though taking mental notes about your style. Then, in the split second when you lower your guard, he exploits your error, plunging his weapon into your heart.*  
*Invisible blades are deadly fighters who prefer to use daggers and related weapons in combat. Their training and techniques with these weapons make them just as lethal as any well-armed fighter. Invisible blades enjoy cultivating misconceptions about the level of danger they present, and they relish any chance to demonstrate that the most unimposing weapons can be the most lethal. Thus, invisible blades are rarely impressed by how mighty their opponents appear.*  
*An invisible blade specializes in fighting with the dagger, kukri, or punching dagger. He is not penalized for using other weapons with which he is proficient, but every class ability he possesses is tied into using one of these three weapons. The typical invisible blade was once a rogue, who chose this path because his sneak attack ability dovetailed nicely with the abilities of this prestige class. Bards and monks are also good candidates, as are barbarians, fighters, and rangers who are willing to exchange their arsenals of weapons for a less cumbersome approach. Clerics and druids seldom choose this class, perceiving its members as faithless, while paladins ironically view invisible blades as too self-absorbed. Sorcerers and wizards rarely become invisible blades because they don't appreciate the class's lack of offensive options and tight focus on weapon use.*  
*NPC invisible blades are silently egotistical gladiators who regard their fighting style as superior to all other martial philosophies. They place enormous emphasis on making a single decisive strike, thereby hoping to end a bout in a single round. Most invisible blades pick up their skills in a guild. A few, however, learn from seasoned professionals who expect a potential gladiator to practice fanatically with the dagger until he can pass the required rite-of-passage combat (see Requirements, below).*

- *Proficiency in the Insight skill*

**Core Traits**
- **Hit Point Die:** D8 per Invisible Blade level

## Level 1: Sneak Attack
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.  
You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.  
The extra damage increases as you gain Invisible Blade levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Invisible Blade Features table.

## Level 1: Unfettered Defense
While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Intelligence modifiers.

## Level 2: Cunning Strike
You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt.  
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
***Bleeding Wound (Cost: 1d6).*** At the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, the target takes 1d6 damage and then makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the wound keeps bleeding. On a successful save, the wound stops bleeding.

## Level 3: Feint
As a Bonus Action, you can feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of yourself as your target. You have Advantage on your next attack roll against that target this turn. If that attack hits, add 1d6 to the attack's damage roll.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 5: Improved Feint
When you feint, you have Advantage on all attack rolls against the chosen target until the start of your next turn.
