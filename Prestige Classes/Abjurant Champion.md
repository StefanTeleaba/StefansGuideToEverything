# Abjurant Champion
*Variant*  
*Prestige Class*  
*Complete Mage v3.5, p.50*

*“The true warrior disdains no weapon, no tool, that might win him the day on the field of battle. And what is magic but another weapon hanging at your side, ready to be drawn and wielded when the need arises?” - Caspian LaMont, Guard-Captain of the Knights Ascendant*  
*While the eldritch knight strives to balance his mystical and martial prowess, and the spellsword uses weapons to channel his spells, the abjurant champion focuses his arcane abilities both to augment his personal defense and to hinder enemy spellcasters. Perfectly suited for martial stalwarts who dabble in magic, this class offers characters the ability to improve their combat skills in ways neither soldiers nor spellcasters can.*  
*Fighter/wizard and paladin/sorcerer are both common paths taken to become an abjurant champion, but given the requirements, any martial-oriented character can qualify by taking a single level of an arcane spellcasting class, from bard to wu jen. Single-classed hexblades or duskblades can qualify but usually lack the abjuration spells that make this combination function best.*  
*As an abjurant champion, your abilities are focused on melding arcane defenses and martial offense into a deadly alloy, a fierce combination of techniques that allow you to overpower or outlast your foes. You are also skilled in utilizing your abilities separately, casting spells or wielding weapons as other classes do.*

## Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Abjurant Champion.  
***Cantrips.*** You know two Abjuration cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain an Abjurant Champion level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Abjuration cantrip of your choice.  
***Spell Slots.*** The Abjurant Champion Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 Abjuration spells.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Abjurant Champion levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Abjurant Champion Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Abjuration spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  
***Changing your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Abjuration spell for which you have spell slots.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Abjurant Champion spells (choose when you gain this feature).  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Abjurant Champion spells.
