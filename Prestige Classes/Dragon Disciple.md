# Dragon Disciple
*Dungeon Master's Guide v3.5, p.183*

*It is known that certain dragons can take humanoid form and even have humanoid lovers. Sometimes a child is born of this union, and every child of that child unto the thousandth generation claims a bit of dragon blood, be it ever so small. Usually, little comes of it, though mighty sorcerers occasionally credit their powers to draconic heritage. For some, however, dragon blood beckons irresistibly. These characters become dragon disciples, who use their magical power as a catalyst to ignite their dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential.*  
*Dragon disciples prefer a life of exploration to a cloistered existence. Most are barbarians, fighters, or rangers who have dabbled as sorcerers or bards. Occasionally, a serious spellcaster explores the path to further a goal of finding out more about his draconic heritage, though at the expense of most of his arcane studies. Clerics and druids rarely choose to become dragon disciples. Already adept at magic, many pursue adventure, especially if it furthers their goal of finding out more about their draconic heritage. All dragon disciples are drawn to areas known to harbor dragons.*

## Level 1: Dragon Scales
Parts of you are covered by dragon-like scales.  
***Damage Resistance.*** You have Resistance to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry feature.  
***Natural Armor.*** While you aren't wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus increases to +2 when you reach Dragon Disciple level 5.

## Level 1: Natural Weapons
The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. You gain the following features.  
***Bite.*** When you use your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can choose to bite with your fangs. You deal Piercing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.  
***Claw.*** When you use your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can choose to slash with your claws. You deal Slashing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.  
***Elemental Damage Die.*** When you use your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you deal additional damage equal to a roll of your Elemental Damage Die. This die changes as you gain Dragon Disciple levels, as shown in the Elemental Damage column of the Dragon Disciple Features table.

## Level 2: Dragon Senses
***Blindsight.*** You gain Blindsight with a range of 10 feet. If you already have Blindsight when you gain this feature, its range increases by 10 feet.

## Level 3: Breath Weapon
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes damage equal to four rolls of your Elemental Damage Die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
