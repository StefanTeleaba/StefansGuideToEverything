# Darkwood Stalker 01

*Complete Warrior, pg.23*

*Elves and orcs are ancient foes, their enmity dating back to times before humans walked the land. Some elves train as elite hunters of the hated orcs. These hunters, called darkwood stalkers among the elves, pursue their age-old enemies with grim determination.*  
*Darkwood stalkers usually come from the ranks of elf (or half-elf) rangers or rogues, although the rare elf barbarian can follow this path as well. Fighters and paladins make poor darkwood stalkers without gaining at least one level in ranger or rogue. Spellcasters rarely take up the mantle of the darkwood stalker, although druids willing to forego spellcasting can fi t well into the order.*  
*Most darkwood stalkers are affi liated with elven military units, although some are lone scouts or field agents.*

### Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack's damage against you (round down).

### Sneak Attack
*3rd-Level Darkwood Stalker Feature*  
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.  
You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.  
The extra damage increases as you gain Darkwood Stalker levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Darkwood Stalker Features table.
