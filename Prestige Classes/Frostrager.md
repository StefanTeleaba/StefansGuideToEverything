# Frostrager
*Prestige Class*  
*Frostburn v3.5, p.60*

*Many barbarian tribes have members whose ferocity and rage impress and terrify even their fellow barbarians, and the tribes of the frostfell are no different. The frostragers are powerful and dangerous warriors believed by some to be gifted from (and others cursed by) the frost giant deity Thrym with an unstable but powerful supernatural battle rage. This terrible fury not only causes the frostrager to increase in size when he enters his battle rage, but infuses his fists and weapons with cold shards of ice. Those tribes that view a frostrager's prowess as a gift point to the fact that their skills in battle can be matched by few, while those that view these abilities as a curse point to the fact that while in a rage, frostragers tend to revel in destruction and slaughter a little too much to make them trustworthy. In truth, frostragers retain control of their actions while in a frostrage... the simple fact is that most frostragers enjoy causing mayhem and destruction.*  
*All frostragers are barbarians to some degree, although many are multiclass barbarian/druids. Stories of such characters who activate their frostrage and wild shape abilities in succession abound in the frostfell; a frostraging character in the shape of a dire bear is a terrible opponent indeed. Other barbarians pick up some levels of fighter or ranger to further focus their combat prowess before becoming frostragers, and a rare few barbarian/sorcerer frostragers exist in some tribes that embrace arcane magic, but other combinations are virtually unknown.*

**Prerequisites**
- *Proficiency with the Intimidation skill*
- *Proficiency with the Survival skill*
- *The character must have been reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by cold damage (either from magical cold attacks or by taking enough damage from exposure to extreme cold environments). Whether or not this trauma is what allows the frostrage to take root in the character's soul, or if the trauma merely unhinges the character's mind enough that he decides to become a frostrager, is unknown.*

**Core Traits**
- **Hit Point Die:** D12 per Frostrager level

## Level 1: Frostrage
You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.  
You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Frostrager level in the Rages column of the Frostrager Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
While active, your Rage follows the rules below.  
***Damage Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, and Cold damage.  
***Rage Damage.*** When you make an attack using Strength with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Frostrager, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Frostrager Features table.  
***Frostrage.*** Your attacks with weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d6 Cold damage on a hit. This extra damage increases as you gain levels as a Frostrager, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Frostrager Features table.  
***Strength Advantage.*** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.  
***No Concentration or Spells.*** You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.  
***Duration.*** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:
- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

## Level 1: Ice Punch
***Bonus Unarmed Strike.*** You can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.  
***Enhanced Unarmed Strike.*** Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike, it can deal your choice of Piercing damage or its normal damage type equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.

## Level 2: Freezing Blood
Sheets of Ice form over your body. You gain the following benefits.  
***Cold Blood.*** You gain a bonus to your Death Saving Throws equal to your Frostrager level.  
***Ice Surge.*** When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to five times your Frostrager level.  
***Icicle Armor.*** If a creature hits you with a melee attack roll while your Rage is active, the creature takes Cold damage equal to twice your Rage Damage.

## Level 3: Absorb Cold
You have Immunity to Cold damage and you regain Hit Points equal to half the amount of Cold damage you would take.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 5: Frostrend
If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra Cold damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d10s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.
