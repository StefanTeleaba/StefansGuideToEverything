# Dark Hunter
*Variant*  
*Prestige Class*  
*Complete Warrior v3.5, p.20*

*Dark hunters specialize in hunting down and eliminating creatures in the dark, twisting caves of the Underdark, often protecting underground communities or those people who make their living under the earth (such as miners or hunters). They use stealth, ambush, and deception to single out foes and remove them one by one. A typical strategy is to locate the enemy, then hide against a nearby wall of earth or stone. The dark hunter then waits for her enemy to pass by, leaping out to attack when the target least expects it. A dark hunter uses her knowledge of underground terrain to find the best areas to create pits, cave-ins, and rockslides, often enabling her to eliminate the enemy without drawing her axe. If a dark hunter is outnumbered, she retreats into the darkness, hiding until she can pick off individual targets.*  
*Because they spend so much time in the stark wilderness of caves and caverns, dark hunters are slightly ostracized by other members of society. Most individuals live among others of their own kind, so the rootless existence of the dark hunter seems like a social aberration. Still, great honor is to be found in protecting the clan from attack, so dark hunters are given respect. None of this concerns the individual, who cares little for what others think; she finds purpose in what she does every time she brings down another one of her enemies. She prefers to work alone, but also knows that cooperation with others has its advantages.*  
*Rangers are the most likely characters to become dark hunters. Druids, rogues, and fighters are also common. Feral tribes of barbaric dwarves sometimes produce dark hunters, who track down their foes in silence and then explode into action once they ambush their prey. Half-orcs make excellent dark hunters, since they are often found on the fringes of society anyway.*

## Level 1: Improved Stone Cunning
As a Bonus Action, you gain Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching a stone surface to use this Tremorsense. The stone can be natural or worked.  
You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
If you already have Stone Cunning when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

## Level 1: Sneak Attack
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.  
You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.  
The extra damage increases as you gain Dark Hunter levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Dark Hunter Features table.

## Level 2: Enhanced Darkvision
You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

## Level 3: Stone's Hue
While you are on a stone surface or touching a stone surface, you have the Invisible condition to any creature that relies on sight to see you. The stone can be natural or worked.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 5: Death Attack
You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt.  
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
***Paralyze (Cost: 1d6).*** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or have the Paralyzed condition until the end of your next turn.
