# Bear Warrior 01

*Complete Warrior, pg.16*

*Many people, particularly those in “uncivilized” regions of the world, revere bears as symbols of the warrior’s strength and battle prowess. By adopting the bear as a totem animal, warriors of these people hope to tap into some of the bear’s strength. Bear warriors, through a special relationship with bear spirits, literally adopt a bear’s strength in the rage of battle, actually transforming into bears while they fight.*  
*Only characters who can already tap into a spiritual power of rage can heighten that power to become bear warriors. Most bear warriors are barbarians, but other multiclass characters sometimes become bear warriors. Characters with another prestige class that grants a rage or frenzy ability occasionally adopt this class.*  
*NPC bear warriors are usually the champions of barbarian tribes, rustic villages, or warlike temples. They lead other warriors not through discipline and order, but by the inspiring example they present.*

## Class Features

### Bear Form
*1st-Level Bear Warrior Feature*  
The power of nature allows you to assume the form of a bear. As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you shape-shift into a Bear form. You stay in that form until your Rage ends. You can also leave the form early (no action required).  
**Known Forms.** You know the Black Bear Form. When you reach certain Bear Warrior levels, you learn new forms, as shown in the Bear Warrior Features table.  
**Rules While Transformed.** While in a Bear Form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:  
***Temporary Hit Points.*** When you assume a Bear Form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Bear Warrior level.  
***Ability Scores.*** While in Bear Form, your ability scores increase by an amount mentioned in each bear form.  
***Game Statistics.*** Your game statistics are replaced by the Bear's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; ability scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Bear's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.  
***Objects.*** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.
