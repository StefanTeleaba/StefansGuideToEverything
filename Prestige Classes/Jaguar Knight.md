## Level 1: Druid Spells
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You can prepare a number of first level Druid spells equal to your Jaguar Knight level. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.  
Starting at 3th level, you can prepare second level Druid spells.  
Starting at 5th level, you can prepare third level Druid spells.  
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

## Level 1: Jaguar Form
The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an Jaguar as a Bonus Action. You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to your Jaguar Knight level or until you have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.  
***Number of Uses.*** You can use Jaguar Form twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
You gain additional uses when you reach certain Jaguar Knight levels, as shown in the Jaguar Form column of the Jaguar Knight Features table.  
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Jaguar Form left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

**Jaguar Form**
| Jaguar Knight Level | Known Forms         |
|:-------------------:|---------------------|
| 1                   | Panther             |
| 3                   | Tiger               |
| 5                   | Saber-Toothed Tiger |

***Rules While Transformed.*** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:  
**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume an Jaguar Form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to three times your Jaguar Knight level.  
**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.  
**No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.  
**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.

## Level 2: Poison Use
You have Immunity to Poison damage and the Poisoned condition.

## Level 3: Cat Eyes
You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 5: Pounce
If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a target immediately before hitting it with a melee attack roll as part of the Attack action, choose one of the following effects: gain a 1d8 bonus to the attack's damage roll, or knock the target Prone if it is no more than one size larger than you. You can use this benefit only once on each of your turns.
