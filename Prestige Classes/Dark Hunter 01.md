## Class Features

### Improved Stone Cunning
*1st-Level Dark Hunter Feature*  
As a Bonus Action, you gain Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes. You must be on a stone surface or touching a stone surface to use this Tremorsense. The stone can be natural or worked.  
You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
If you already have Stone Cunning when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

### Enhanced Darkvision
*2nd-Level Dark Hunter Feature*  
You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

### Sneak Attack
*3rd-Level Dark Hunter Feature*  
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's type.  
You don't need Advantage on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.  
The extra damage increases as you gain Dark Hunter levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Dark Hunter Features table.

### Stone's Hue
*4th-Level Dark Hunter Feature*  
While you are on a stone surface or touching a stone surface, you have the Invisible condition to any creature that relies on sight to see you. The stone can be natural or worked.

### Death Attack
*5th-Level Dark Hunter Feature*  
You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt.  
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
***Paralyze (Cost: 1d6).*** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or have the Paralyzed condition until the end of your next turn.
