# Dragonborn, Gem
Gem dragonborn partake of the heritage of gem dragons, who claim to be heirs of Sardior, the Ruby Dragon. The colors and mysterious powers of gem dragons—amethyst, crystal, emerald, sapphire, and topaz—gleam in these dragonborn's scaled skin and course through their veins. Theirs are the wonders of the mind, the force of will, the brilliant light of insight, and the resounding echo of discovery—but also the desiccation of despair.

## Gem Dragonborn Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid  
**Size:** Medium (about 5-7 feet tall)  
**Speed:** 30 feet  

As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.

***Gem Ancestry.*** Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Gem Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits as well as your appearance.

**Gem Ancestors**  
| Dragon   | Damage Type |
|----------|-------------|
| Amethyst | Force       |
| Crystal  | Radiant     |
| Emerald  | Psychic     |
| Sapphire | Thunder     |
| Topaz    | Necrotic    |

***Breath Weapon.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Gem Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10).  
You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have Resistance to the damage type determined by your Gem Ancestry trait.

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Psionic Mind.*** You can send telepathic messages to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand these messages, but it must be able to understand at least one language to comprehend them.

***Gem Flight.*** When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a Bonus Action, you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the Incapacitated condition. During that time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
