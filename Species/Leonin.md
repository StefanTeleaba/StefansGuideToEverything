# Leonin
The leonin guard the shining lands of Oreskos, a golden plain where even the gods rarely trespass. Prides of these nomadic, lion-like humanoids rarely interact with other peoples, having all they need in their shimmering homeland and knowing the treachery of strangers. Still, some leonin wonder what lies beyond Oreskos's border mountains and seek to test themselves in a wider world.

## Leonin Traits

**Creature Type:** Humanoid  
**Size:** Medium (about 6-7 feet tall)  
**Speed:** 35 feet

As a Leonin, you have these special traits.

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Claws.*** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you can deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

***Hunter's Instincts.*** You gain proficiency in either Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, or Survival.

***Daunting Roar.*** As a Bonus Action, you can let out an especially menacing roar. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
