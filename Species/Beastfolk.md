# Beastfolk
*The Ultimate Adventurer's Handbook*  

*“One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.” — Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species*

*Beastfolk is a catchall term for a collection of humanoid peoples, each of which bear a strong resemblance to an animal. Due to the dizzying variety of animals in the world, and beastfolk that take after them, beastfolk as a whole have few common bonds. They may form small communities, particularly if they all resemble the same animal, but most often live on the edges of civilization, interacting only with those who possess the insight to see beastfolk are at least as much human as they are animal.*  
**Fur & Feather**  
*Every beastfolk resembles an anthropomorphic animal of one kind or another. The ratio of humanoid to bestial qualities varies between beastfolk but they are always recognizable as a hybrid between beast and humanoid. Beastfolk can stand anywhere from three and a half feet to seven feet tall with their height being influenced by the size of the beast they take after. They likewise weigh anywhere from 60 to 300 pounds.*  
*Beastfolk may be covered in fur, feathers, scales, or skin. They often share the eye coloration and shape of the animal they resemble. Depending on their breed traits, a beastfolk may have wings, claws, gills, or even more exotic physical features.*  
**Born & Raised**  
*The majority of beastfolk are born as beastfolk. Members of beastfolk families all typically resemble the same species of animal. These beastfolk sometimes form isolated settlements that have little, if any, contact with other humanoid races. Many beastfolk who are born to the race identify strongly with the animal they resemble and so mistrust beastfolk who resemble that animal's natural predators and other humanoids.*  
**Cursed & Broken**  
*Some rare beastfolk are unfortunate souls who were cursed to the shape. Whether they transgressed against the gods, crossed a foul-tempered spellcaster, or provoked a curse from a sorcerous relic, these beastfolk began their life as something else. Often the animal they resemble is some cruel or ironic reference to the circumstances surrounding their curse. For example, a gluttonous noble may be transformed into a pig beastfolk, a soldier who abandons their military post may be cursed to become a chicken beastfolk, and a cold-hearted assassin might be turned into a serpent beastfolk.*  
**Why They Adventure**  
*Beastfolk who take up a life of adventuring do so to survive. Beastfolk are often treated poorly by other humanoids, giving them few options for making a living that don't involve risking their lives. Those who live alone in the wilderness might take up adventuring because the natural resources or security of their homeland are threatened.*  
*Beastfolk who are cursed to the form may have been adventurers before they took on their bestial appearance. Regardless of when or how, many of these beastfolk's adventuring careers revolve around looking for a way to reverse the curse and return to their old selves. Rarely, over the course of adventuring the beastfolk grows accustomed to their new shape and abandons or even rejects attempts to return them to their old form.*  
*In a party, those traits that set beastfolk apart from other humanoids become their greatest assets. In the crucible of a danger filled dungeon, beastfolk quickly earn the trust and friendship that so often eludes them.*
**Beastfolk Names**  
*Beastfolk names vary by their background. Beastfolk cursed to their form typically keep their old names, though some take on a new one to mask their true identity. Those born as beastfolk have a personal name and a community name. Their personal name is given to them by their parents at adolescence and reflects a notable physical characteristic, hobby, or habit. The community name is the name of the settlement or region where the beastfolk was born.*  
***Personal Names.*** Brownfeather, Cheeks, Chirp, Finder, Fullbelly, Growler, Hunter, Knuckles, Redfur, Shadow, Strongtail, Swift, Tails, Tusk  
***Community Names.*** Baratok, Bluestones, Cloakwood, Erie, Greensea, Ironwood, Lammania, Moonshae, Styrnia, Taer Valaestas, Tethir, Whitewater  
**Chimerakin**  
*When a beastfolk begins to manifest characteristics of two or more beasts, rather than just one, other beastfolk are likely to label them a chimerakin. This label means ostracization from any beastfolk community the chimerakin encounters, including their family. Other than the distinction in social standing, there is no difference between a beastfolk and a chimerakin (except that chimerakin can speak with two or more types of animals with their Beastkin Tongue trait).*  
*With your DM's permission when you make your beastfolk character, you can roll a d100 to determine whether or not you are chimerakin. If you roll the number 13, the breed traits you select with your All Creatures Under the Sun trait do not have to be representative of a single creature. Otherwise, beastfolk with the Beast Whisperer feat are often accused of having chimerakin blood while those with the Extra Breed Traits feat are nearly universally condemned as chimerakin.*
