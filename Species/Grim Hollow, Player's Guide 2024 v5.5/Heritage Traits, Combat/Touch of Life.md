# Touch of Life

Effects that corrupt the essence of other living creatures are of little concern to you. You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.  
***Strength of Life.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail a saving throw against an effect that deals Necrotic damage, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
