# Natural Attack

The gift of natural weaponry means you are never unarmed, as your foes learn to their peril. Your Unarmed Strikes deal damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The type of damage dealt by your Unarmed Strikes can be Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing, based on the type of natural weaponry you possess (claws, horns, a tail, and so forth).  
***Swift Strike.*** If you take this trait twice, you can use Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
