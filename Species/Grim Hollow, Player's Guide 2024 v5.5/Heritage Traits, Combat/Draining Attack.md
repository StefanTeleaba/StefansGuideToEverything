# Draining Attack

As your enemy's life force ebbs, you grow ever stronger. If you have the Natural Attack trait, each time you hit with an Unarmed Strike, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt by the attack.  
***To the Dregs.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Draining Attack, the target also takes a penalty to their Hit Point maximum equal to the damage dealt by the attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
