# Relentless Endurance

The battles you need yet to fight are many, and death is not an option. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Unparalleled Endurance.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Relentless Endurance, you drop to 1d6 Hit Points + your Proficiency Bonus. Additionally, when you use Relentless Endurance, you can use a Reaction to spend up to five Hit Dice, rolling them and gaining that number of Hit Points.
