# Reach Attack

As you hurl yourself into battle, your foes discover that trying to keep away from you won't save them. Your reach increases by 5 feet. This extra reach doesn't apply to Opportunity Attacks.  
***Opportune Reach.*** If you take this trait twice, your extra reach from Reach Attack applies to Opportunity Attacks.
