# Awakened Mind

The dangers of Etharis have given you a focus that allows you to shrug off debilitating magical effects. You automatically succeed on saving throws against magical effects that would give you the Incapacitated, Stunned, or Unconscious conditions. This does not include effects that leave you Unconscious because you are reduced to 0 Hit Points.  
***Reawakened.*** If you take this trait twice, you also have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.
