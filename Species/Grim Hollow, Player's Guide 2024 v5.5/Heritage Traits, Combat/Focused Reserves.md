# Focused Reserves

No matter how badly beaten down you are, you find the will to keep fighting when you most need it. As a Reaction after you take damage, you can roll a number of d6s equal to your Proficiency Bonus and gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the total. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Focused Edge.*** If you take this trait twice, you can reroll 1s and 2s when you use Focused Reserves, but you must use the new rolls.
