# Focused Mind

Your strength of will protects you from magic that would corrupt your mind. You have Advantage on saving throws against being Charmed.  
***Immutable Mind.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail a saving throw against being Charmed, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
