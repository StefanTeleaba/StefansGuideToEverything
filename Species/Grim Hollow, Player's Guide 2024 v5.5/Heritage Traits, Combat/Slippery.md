# Slippery

Any enemy that tries to grab you is in for a surprise. You have Advantage on Athletics and Acrobatics checks to escape a grapple.  
***Supreme Slip.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail an Athletics or Acrobatics check to escape a grapple, you can use your Reaction to succeed instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
