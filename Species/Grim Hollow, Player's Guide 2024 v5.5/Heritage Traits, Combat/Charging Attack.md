# Charging Attack

The fury with which you throw yourself into battle forces your foes to feel your wrath. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike on the same turn, you can make another attack against the same target as a Bonus Action with the same weapon.  
***Furious Charge.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Charging Attack, you have Advantage on all attacks after the triggering movement until the end of your turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
