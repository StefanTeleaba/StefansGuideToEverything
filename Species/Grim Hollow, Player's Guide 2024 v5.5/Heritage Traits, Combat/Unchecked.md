# Unchecked

Your ability to stay in motion is second to none, and foes try in vain to pin you down. You have Advantage on saving throws against being Restrained.  
***Slip Free.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail a saving throw against being Restrained, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
