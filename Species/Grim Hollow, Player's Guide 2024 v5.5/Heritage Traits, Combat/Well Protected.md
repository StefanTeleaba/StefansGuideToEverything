# Well Protected

Your ability to roll with even the worst attacks means that armor would only slow you down. When you are not wearing armor, your AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier.  
***Protective Cover.*** If you take this trait twice, when you make a Dexterity saving throw or are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use a Reaction to have Advantage on the saving throw or impose Disadvantage on the ranged attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
