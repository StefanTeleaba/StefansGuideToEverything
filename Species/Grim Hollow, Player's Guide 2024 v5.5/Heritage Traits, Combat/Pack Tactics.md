# Pack Tactics

Staying close to your allies in combat makes you even more dangerous. When you start your turn with at least one ally who isn't Incapacitated within 5 feet of another creature you can see, you can use your Reaction to have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your turn.  
***Pack Instinct.*** If you take this trait twice, gaining Advantage from Pack Tactics requires no action.
