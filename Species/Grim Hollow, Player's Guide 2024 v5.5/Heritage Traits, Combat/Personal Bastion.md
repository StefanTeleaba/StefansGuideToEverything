# Personal Bastion

Focusing all your resolve, you stand fast and watch your enemies flail against your defenses. As a Magic action, you become motionless and gain the following effects:
- You have a +4 bonus to AC.
- You have Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- You have Advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws.
- Your Speed is 0 and you can't benefit from any bonus to your Speed.
- You lose Concentration.

You can't take actions, and you can't use your Bonus Action except to end the effect of this trait.  
***Mobile Bastion.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Personal Bastion, your Speed is reduced to half your normal Speed (rounded down), you do not have Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you can use Bonus Actions.
