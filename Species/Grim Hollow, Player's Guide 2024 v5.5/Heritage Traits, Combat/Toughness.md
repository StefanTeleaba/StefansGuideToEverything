# Toughness

An intrinsic hardiness marks you as one born for battle. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 each time you gain a level.  
***Extra Tough.*** If you take this trait twice, your Hit Point maximum increases by 2 instead of 1, and it increases by 2 each time you gain a level.  
Additionally, when you make a saving throw against an effect that would decrease your Hit Point maximum, you have Advantage on the save. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
