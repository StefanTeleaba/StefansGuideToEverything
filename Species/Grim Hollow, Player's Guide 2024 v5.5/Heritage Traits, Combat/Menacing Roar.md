# Menacing Roar

Your battle cry can cause even the most formidable foes to quail before you. As a Bonus Action, you emit a roar, shout, or other loud vocal outburst. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution modifier) or have the Frightened condtion until the end of your next turn. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Incomparable Roar.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Menacing Roar, one target of your choice has Disadvantage on the saving throw.
