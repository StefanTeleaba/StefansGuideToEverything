# Lucky

The luck you carry will see you through the worst Etharis has to offer. When you roll a 1 on a D20 Test, you can reroll that die but must use the new roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Master of Fortune.*** If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage on the reroll made with Lucky.
