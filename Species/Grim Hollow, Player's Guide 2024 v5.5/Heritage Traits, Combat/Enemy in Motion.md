# Enemy in Motion

A lifetime spent wandering lets you judge when others' movement works to your benefit. When you make an attack roll against a creature or make a saving throw against a creature's attack, spell, or ability, you can use a Reaction to have Advantage on the attack roll or saving throw if that creature moved since the end of your last turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Moving Insight.*** If you take this trait twice, Enemy in Motion also lets you use your Reaction to affect an ally's attack roll or saving throw if your ally is within 30 feet.
