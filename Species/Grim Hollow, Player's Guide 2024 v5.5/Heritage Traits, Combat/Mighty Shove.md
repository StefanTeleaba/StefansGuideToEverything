# Mighty Shove

Your powerful blows send your targets reeling. When you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with a melee attack, you can use a Bonus Action to attempt to shove that creature. The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus) or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you.  
***Overwhelming Shove.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Mighty Shove, the target creature has Disadvantage on the saving throw.
