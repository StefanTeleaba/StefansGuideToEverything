# Brave

The horrors you've lived through have hardened you. You have Advantage on saving throws to avoid being Frightened.  
***Infectious Bravery.*** If you take this trait twice, you can use your Reaction to bolster the spirits of your allies, granting one ally who can see or hear you Advantage on a saving throw against being Frightened. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
