# Psychic Spirit

Your strength of mind shields you from unnatural forces. You have Resistance to Psychic damage.  
***Spirit's Strength.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail a saving throw against an effect that deals Psychic damage, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
