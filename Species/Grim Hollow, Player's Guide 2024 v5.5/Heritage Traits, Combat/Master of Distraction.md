# Master of Distraction

You draw your foes' attention to you, intending it to be the last diversion they ever see. As an Influence action, you put on a tactical display (bravado, cowardice, confusion, or some other tactic) that gets your enemies' attention. Until the end of your next turn, any attack on an enemy within 10 feet of you that could see you when you took the Influence action, is made with Advantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Hindering Distraction.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Master of Distraction, one affected enemy of your choice also has Disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against any of your allies until the end of your next turn.
