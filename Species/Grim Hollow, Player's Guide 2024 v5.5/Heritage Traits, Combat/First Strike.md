# First Strike

Hesitation in others is a weakness you've learned to take deadly advantage of. When you hit a creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet, your attack deals an extra 2d6 damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Strong Strike.*** If you take this trait twice, you can use the maximum value of the extra damage dice from First Strike, rather than rolling. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
