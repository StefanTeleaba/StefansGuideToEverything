# Skirmish Tactics

Your brutal strike leaves your foe reeling as you slip away. When you hit a hostile creature with an attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, Opportunity Attacks against you by that creature have Disadvantage until the end of your turn.  
***Supreme Skirmisher.*** If you take this trait twice, when you hit a hostile creature with an attack with a weapon attack or an Unarmed Strike, you can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action until the end of your turn.
