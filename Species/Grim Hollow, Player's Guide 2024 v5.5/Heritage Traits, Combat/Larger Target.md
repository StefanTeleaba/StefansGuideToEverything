# Larger Target

Foes that outsize you quickly learn to fear your wrath. If you hit a creature that is one size larger than you, you can choose to deal extra damage to the creature equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You can use this feature a number of times equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Even Larger.*** If you take this trait twice, Larger Target applies to creatures of any size larger than you.
