# Timely Boon

Fortune favors you at times when a threat might send you down. When you fail a saving throw, you can use your Reaction to roll a d4 and add it to the save, potentially turning it into a success. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Born Lucky.*** If you take this trait twice, you roll a d8 instead of a d4 when you use Timely Boon.
