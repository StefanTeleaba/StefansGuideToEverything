# Battlefield Control

When foes attempt to press you in melee, they do so at their peril. Other creatures provoke Opportunity Attacks from you whenever they move into your reach, in addition to when they move out of your reach.  
***Battlefield Dominance.*** If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage on Opportunity Attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
