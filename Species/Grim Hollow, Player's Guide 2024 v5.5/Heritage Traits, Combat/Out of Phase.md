# Out of Phase

Your corporeal presence shifts and fades, softening your enemies' ability to harm you. As a Bonus Action, for 1 minute, all creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you can move through other creature's spaces without treating them as Difficult Terrain. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Phase Shift.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Out of Phase, you can extend its benefit to any ally within 10 feet of you.
