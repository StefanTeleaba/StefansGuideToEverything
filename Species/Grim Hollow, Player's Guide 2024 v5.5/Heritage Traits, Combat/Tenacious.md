# Tenacious

Your enemies might put you down, but you are never down for long. You have Advantage on Death Saving Throws.  
***Hard to Kill.*** If you take this trait twice, when you drop to 0 Hit Points but don't die outright, you remain conscious. You must make Death Saving Throws as normal while at 0 Hit Points, and you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure each time you take any damage, but you can otherwise act freely. You can't become Stable while you remain at 0 Hit Points in this way.
