# Creature Cover

By slipping behind enemies or allies alike, you are able to fade from view with ease. You can take the Hide action even when you have Half Cover from a creature, as long as that creature is of a size larger than you.  
***Subtle Cover.*** If you take this trait twice, you can take the Hide action when you have Half Cover from a creature the same size as you.
