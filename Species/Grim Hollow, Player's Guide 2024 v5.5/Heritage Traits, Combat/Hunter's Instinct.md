# Hunter's Instinct

You summon a surge of ferocity when your prey least expects it. At the end of each Long Rest, you gain a number of d8s equal to your Proficiency Bonus. When you make an attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can roll a d8 and add it to either the attack roll or the damage roll. If you add it to the d20 roll, you can decide to roll the d8 after the d20 roll is made, but you must do so before the outcome of the roll is known.  
***Relentless Instinct.*** If you take this trait twice, whenever you use Hunter's Instinct for an attack roll, if the attack roll misses, you retain the d8 and can use it again.
