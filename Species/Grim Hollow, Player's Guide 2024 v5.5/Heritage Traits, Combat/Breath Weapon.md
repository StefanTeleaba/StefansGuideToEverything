# Breath Weapon

A connection to draconic or elemental fury lets you unleash a blast of destructive energy. When you select this trait, choose a damage type: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder. Then choose an area of effect: a Line that is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long, or a 15-foot Cone.  
When you use a Magic action to expel your Breath Weapon, each creature in the area of effect must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency Bonus). A target creature takes 1d8 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach character levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Potent Breath.*** If you take this trait multiple times, you gain an additional breath weapon each time, with its own number of uses, damage type, and area of effect. Additionally, when you use any of your Breath Weapons, one target of your choice has Disadvantage on the saving throw. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
