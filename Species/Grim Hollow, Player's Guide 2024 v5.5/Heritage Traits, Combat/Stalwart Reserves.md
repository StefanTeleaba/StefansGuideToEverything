# Stalwart Reserves

Each time you lay into a foe, their state of peril lends you vigor. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use your Reaction to roll a number of d4s equal to your Proficiency Bonus and gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the total rolled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Stalwart Edge.*** If you take this trait twice, you can take the maximum number of Temporary Hit Points rather than rolling.
