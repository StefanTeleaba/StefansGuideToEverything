# Divine Sangromancy

A connection to the life force of others lets you shape that force to their benefit. Whenever an allied creature within 30 feet of you regains Hit Points, you can spend a Hit Die and add the roll of the die to the number of Hit Points gained by the ally.  
***Sangromancy Savant.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Divine Sangromancy, you also regain Hit Points equal to your Hit Die roll.
