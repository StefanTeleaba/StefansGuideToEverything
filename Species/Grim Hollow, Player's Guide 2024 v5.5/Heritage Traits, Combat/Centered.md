# Centered

By focusing your inner strength, you gain a needed edge. As a Bonus Action, you grant yourself Advantage on an attack roll or ability check you make before the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Centered Edge.*** If you take this trait twice, when you succeed on the attack roll or ability check made while using Centered, you can choose one creature within 30 feet of you. That creature has Advantage on the next attack roll or ability check they make before the start of your next turn.
