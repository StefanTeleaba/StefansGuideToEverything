# Power Nap

When you don't know how long it might be before your next full respite, you learn to take maximum advantage of any rest you can get. When taking a Short Rest, you can choose to sleep for 1 hour. If you do so, you reduce your Exhaustion by one level and regain a Hit Point Die in addition to the other benefits of a Short Rest.  
***Extreme Resilience.*** If you take this trait twice, when using Power Nap, you can choose to regain a single resource that would normally refresh on a Long Rest. For example, a Sorcerer could choose to regain a Sorcery Point on a Short Rest.
