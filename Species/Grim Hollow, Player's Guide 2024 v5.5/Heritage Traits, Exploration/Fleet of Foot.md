# Fleet of Foot

As you've learned more than once, moving fast is often the best way to avoid trouble. Your Speed increases by 5 feet.  
***Shared Fleetness.*** If you take this trait twice, your Speed increases by another 5 feet, for a total increase of 10 feet.  
Additionally, as a Bonus Action, choose any number of creatures within 30 feet. Those creatures gain a 10 foot bonus to their Speed for 1 minute. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
