# Environmental Awareness

The natural world is a dangerous place, and your connection to specific parts of that world grants you an edge in survival. Choose an environment: arctic, coastal, desert, forest, grassland, hill and mountain, swamp, subterranean, or underwater. While in that environment, whenever you make an ability check to assess structures, monuments, or natural features; to find food or drinkable water; or to track creatures, you are considered to have proficiency in the appropriate skill for the check, and you add double your Proficiency Bonus to the check instead of your normal bonus.  
***Adaptive Awareness.*** If you take this trait multiple times, you gain its benefit for a new environment each time.  
Additionally, when you make an ability check using Environmental Awareness, you have Advantage on the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
