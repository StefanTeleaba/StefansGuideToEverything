# Powerful Build

Whether carrying well-earned loot or the body of a fallen companion, you shoulder that load with ease. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. A Small creature with this trait can use any weapon with Heavy as long as they have proficiency with that weapon. (This is an Exploration trait.)  
***Powerful Shove.*** If you take this trait twice, you can move or knock foes prone with ease. When you use Unarmed Strike to shove a creature 5 feet or give it the Prone condition, the target has Disadvantage on the saving throw. (This is a Combat trait.)
