You excel at aiding your allies, knowing that the time will come when you need them to return the favor. You can use the Help action as a Bonus Action to assist any ally making an ability check. (This is an Exploration trait.)  
***Helpful Tactics.*** If you take this trait twice, when you use Helping Hand, you can also assist an ally making an attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. (This is a Combat trait.)
