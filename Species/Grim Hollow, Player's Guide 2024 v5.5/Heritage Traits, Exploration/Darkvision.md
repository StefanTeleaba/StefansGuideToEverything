# Darkvision

A life spent in shadow has made you grow accustomed to the gloom. You can see in Dim Light within 60 feet of you as if it were Bright Light, and in Darkness within 60 feet of you as if it were Dim Light. You can't discern color in Darkness, only shades of gray.  
***Improved Darkvision.*** If you take this trait twice, the range of your Darkvision increases to 120 feet.
