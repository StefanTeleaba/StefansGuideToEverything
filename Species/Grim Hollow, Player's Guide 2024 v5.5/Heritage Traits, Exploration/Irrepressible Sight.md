# Irrepressible Sight

Any foe you can see is a foe you can take downâ€”so you make sure nothing prevents you from seeing. You have Advantage on saving throws against having the Blinded condition.  
***Resolute Sight.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail a saving throw against having the Blinded condition, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature after you finish a Long Rest.
