# Climber

Sometimes staying away from what threatens you means getting clear of those threats. You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.  
***Wall Walker.*** If you take this trait twice, you can use your Climb Speed to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.  
Additionally, while using climbing movement, you can use the Dash action as a Bonus Action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
