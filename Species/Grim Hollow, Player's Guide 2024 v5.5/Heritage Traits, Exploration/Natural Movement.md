# Natural Movement

The time you've spent in the natural world lets you travel at speed, and hinders the abilities of those who would hunt you. Choose an environment: arctic, coastal, desert, forest, grassland, hill and mountain, swamp, subterranean, or underwater. While in that environment, moving through nonmagical Difficult Terrain costs you no extra movement, and ability checks made to track you have Disadvantage.  
***Shared Movement.*** If you take this trait multiple times, you gain its benefits for a new environment each time. Additionally, while in any environment chosen for Natural Movement, as a Bonus Action, you can grant creatures of your choice the benefit of Natural Movement for 1 hour, as long as those creatures remain within 120 feet of you and can see you.
