# Natural Camouflage

Your ability to fade into the background of familiar territory helps keep you safe from threats. Choose an environment: arctic, coastal, desert, forest, grassland, hill and mountain, swamp, subterranean, or underwater. You have Advantage on Stealth checks made with the Hide action while in that environment.  
***Shared Camouflage.*** If you take this trait multiple times, you gain its benefits for a new environment each time.  
Additionally, when you take the Hide action, you can forgo making a Stealth check while in any environment chosen with Natural Camouflage, instead treating the check as if you had rolled a 15. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
