# Tireless

An innate resilience lets you shake off conditions that would take others down. You have Advantage on saving throws connected to gaining or removing Exhaustion levels.  
***Vigorous.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail a saving throw against Exhaustion, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
