# Even in Sleep

An instinctive sense for danger protects you at all times. While you have the Unconscious condition while asleep, you are aware of your surroundings and can make Perception checks normally.  
***Sleeping Ward.*** If you take this trait twice, while you are asleep, you automatically detect the presence of any creature intending harm to you that moves within 30 feet of you. A creature that is simply capable of harming you does not trigger this trait until it has intent to do so. For example, a wild animal might approach you cautiously, then decide to attack only when it realizes you are sleeping.
