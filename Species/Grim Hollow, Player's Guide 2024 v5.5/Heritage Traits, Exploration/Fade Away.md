# Fade Away

You have learned to avoid notice at all costs, letting you momentarily obscure yourself from observation. As a Bonus Action, you can take the Hide action to conceal yourself without needing to be Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover. You need not be out of a creature's line of sight to use this ability.  
You become visible at the start of your next turn unless you have moved into a position that allows you to use the Hide action normally. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Long Fade.*** If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage on your ability check when you take the Hide action from Fade Away, and you become visible at the end of your next turn instead of the start of your next turn.
