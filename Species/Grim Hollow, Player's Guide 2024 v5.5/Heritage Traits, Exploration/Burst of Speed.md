# Burst of Speed

The many things that want to kill you must catch you first. On your turn, you can increase your Speed by 30 feet until the end of your turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Furious Speed.*** If you take this trait twice, on a turn when you use Burst of Speed, you don't provoke Opportunity Attacks.
