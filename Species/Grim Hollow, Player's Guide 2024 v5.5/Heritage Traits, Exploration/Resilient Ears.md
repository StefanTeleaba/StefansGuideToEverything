# Resilient Ears

Even as destruction rains down around you, your hearing stays sharp. You have Advantage on saving throws against having the Deafened condition.  
***Determined Hearing.*** If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage on Perception checks involving hearing. Additionally, when you fail a saving throw against being Deafened, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
