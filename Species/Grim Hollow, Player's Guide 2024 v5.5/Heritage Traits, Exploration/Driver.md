# Driver

The roads and waterways of Etharis are often no less dangerous than the open wilderness, and you dedicate yourself to moving others safely on those routes. You have proficiency with Navigator's Tools, and you have Advantage on ability checks made to drive a vehicle.  
***Remarkable Driver.*** If you take this trait twice, you can make checks involving driving a vehicle that require an action without having to use your action. You can only get this free use once per round.
