# Supple Squeeze

With an effort of will, you contort your body into the tightest spaces. You can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature two sizes smaller than you, rather than one size smaller.  
***Full-Speed Squeeze.*** If you take this trait twice, squeezing does not cost you additional movement, and you do not have Disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws while squeezing.
