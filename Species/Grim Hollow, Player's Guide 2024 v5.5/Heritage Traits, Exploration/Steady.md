# Steady

No matter what kind of upheaval surrounds you, you stand your ground. You have Advantage on saving throws against having the Prone condition.  
***Stand Fast.*** If you take this trait twice, standing from Prone takes only five feet of movement instead of half your movement.  
Additionally, when you fail a saving throw against being knocked Prone, you can use your Reaction to succeed on the save instead. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
