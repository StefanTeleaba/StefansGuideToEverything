# Artificial Form

You were made, not born, and your unnatural origin forever marks you as different. You are a Construct, but your enchanted form still benefits from healing spells. You can also heal yourself by spending Hit Dice during Short Rests and Long Rests, as normal.  
You don't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You must still be inactive for 8 hours during a Long Rest to gain its benefits.  
***Self-Repair.*** If you take this trait twice, when the Mending cantrip is cast on you, you can spend a Hit Die to regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll of the die plus your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 Hit Point). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
