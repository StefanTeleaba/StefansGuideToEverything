# Meditative Rest

Sleep is a luxury you've never needed to afford. When you rest, you meditate deeply for 4 hours, dreaming but remaining conscious. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that other humanoids do from 8 hours of sleep.  
***Restorative Rest.*** If you take this trait twice, you need to spend only 2 hours in your meditation to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep, and you gain a d6 at the end of each Long Rest. Before the end of your next Long Rest, you can roll the d6 and add it to any d20 Test you make. You can decide to roll the d6 after the d20 Test is made, but you must do so before the outcome of the roll is known.
