# Ethereal Fade

Shifting away from the mortal world lets you move through and observe that world unseen. As a Magic action, you fade from the Material Plane into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. While you remain in this state, you can't interact with the Material Plane, and effects on the Material Plane can't affect you, including spells and creatures. You can move and hear as normal, and you see everything in shades of gray. When the effect ends, you reappear in the Material Plane in the closest unoccupied space to where you faded from. You can end the effect early as a Bonus Action. You regain the use of this feature again when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Ethereal Focus.*** If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage when making Wisdom checks as part of a Search action.
