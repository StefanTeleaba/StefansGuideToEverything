# Standing Leap

Threats on the ground are of little concern as you leap over them with ease. You can make a Long Jump of up to 20 feet and a High Jump of up to 10 feet, with or without a running start. If your Speed is less than the distance you can Long Jump, you can leap only a distance equal to your Speed.  
***Incredible Leap.*** If you take this trait twice, you can make a Long Jump of up to 30 feet and a High Jump of up to 15 feet, as limited by your speed.  
Additionally, when you jump out of another creature's reach, the movement of the jump does not provoke Opportunity Attacks from that creature. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.
