# Crafter's Eye

The history of Etharis is written in relics, and you read that history better than most. When you make a History check related to any object (an item, device, building, or material) and you have proficiency in an Artisan's Tools associated with creating that object, you are considered proficient in History and you add double your Proficiency Bonus to the check instead of your normal bonus.  
***Crafter's Cunning.*** If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage on the History checks you make with Crafter's Eye. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
