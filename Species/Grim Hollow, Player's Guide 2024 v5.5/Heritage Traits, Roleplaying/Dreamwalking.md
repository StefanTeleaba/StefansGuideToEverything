# Dreamwalking

Whenever you rest, you touch the dreams of those around you, seeding their thoughts and memories into your own mind. When you make an ability check to recall lore or knowledge, you have Advantage on the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Secret Dreams.*** If you take this trait twice, you gain an instinctive knowledge of the secrets of other creatures while you touch their dreams. Using a Search action, you focus on one creature you can see and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check. With a successful check, you learn one secret of the GM's choice known to that creature. The secrets of creatures that don't have a language come to you as vague images and impressions. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
