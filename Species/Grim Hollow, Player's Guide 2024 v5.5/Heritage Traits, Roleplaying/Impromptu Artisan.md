# Impromptu Artisan

You've never known the luxury of always having the gear you need, but you have more than learned to make do. If you possess Artisan's Tools with which you have proficiency, and if you have access to appropriate raw materials and any additional necessary equipment (as the GM determines), you can use a Short Rest to craft any one nonmagical item worth 10 GP or less, including:
- Adventuring gear
- A weapon or shield
- A unique item that performs a simple function approved by the GM

The gear you create is workable but not high quality, and can't be sold except as the GM determines.  
***Master Artisan.*** If you take this trait twice, you can use Impromptu Artisan during a Long Rest, during which you craft one nonmagical item worth 50 GP or less.
