# Skill Prowess

Your ingenuity and inventiveness help keep you alive in a dangerous world. Before you make an ability check using a skill you are proficient with, you can add your Proficiency Bonus again. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Skill Mastery.*** If you take this trait twice, when you fail an ability check made using the Skill Prowess trait, you can reroll the check and must use the new roll.
