# Eager Deceiver

You long ago learned that being open with others only gives them power over you. You have proficiency in the Deception skill.  
***Expert Deceiver.*** If you take this trait twice, you have Advantage on Deception checks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
