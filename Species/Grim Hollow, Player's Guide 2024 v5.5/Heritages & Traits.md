# Heritages and Traits
## Character Creation
Character creation for a Grim Hollow campaign is similar to creating a character for any 5e-compatible game, but the dark fantasy style of Grim Hollow invites you to think about your character in a different context. The darkness of Etharis is more than something that you step into; rather, the darkness seeps into you.

With that in mind, Grim Hollow offers several new player character options: a new class, subclasses, backgrounds, feats, equipment, and spells—as well as the unique Heritage System and Transformations.

With the Heritage System, you can choose from a variety of heritage traits to build a character to your unique specifications. Are you a Dwarf who grew up in the cold Valikan tundra instead of under a mountain? You can reflect that in your heritage.

Transformations are another potential tool for creating a character that meets the demands of the dark and dangerous stories told in Etharis. Cursed with lycanthropy, bitten by a vampire, or cursed by a hag? Rather than being relegated to NPC status or handwaving what should be a monumental and dramatic part of your character, Transformations allow the story to continue in more interesting and dramatic ways.

Throughout this section, you can let your dark imagination run free. Envision what it might be like to play a dark, cursed, complicated character not just through the story of the campaign, but through the rules themselves. Whether you take full advantage of the rules provided here or stick to the more traditional species, classes, and backgrounds, always keep in mind that the lands and people of Etharis—and the threats lurking across the realms of that strange and terrible land—don't give a whit that you're a hero. They only care about how mighty you are—even if that might is fed by darkness.

Humans dominate the world of Etharis. The folk known as the elder peoples—the dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings—are spread throughout human lands or concentrated in the isolated realms they retained after the conquests of the Era of Expansion. Although those heritages represent the most common folk of the world, the Grim Hollow campaign setting features a much broader range of heritage options with which to build your character—and a system of character creation that can help make the player characters in a Grim Hollow campaign truly unique.

## Characters in a Grim Hollow Campaign
The world of Grim Hollow offers players new rules for creating characters to explore the world and enhance roleplaying. Use the guidelines in this section alongside the normal fifth edition character-building rules to create a character for a Grim Hollow campaign.

### Choosing a Heritage
For Grim Hollow campaigns, available heritages are grouped into three categories—common heritages, rare heritages, and eldritch heritages.

The common heritages of Etharis are the dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gnomes, halflings, and humans whose cultures and nations have defined the history of the continent.

The rare heritages are the folk who dwell on the fringes of more widespread cultures, often treated as outsiders and struggling to find their place in the world—the dreamers, grudgels, laneshi, and ogresh.

Then there are the eldritch heritages of the accursed, arisen, dhampir, disembodied, downcast, wechselkind, and wulven—creatures whose creation or nature is touched by magic, living as true outsiders with no culture of their own.

**Humanoid Type**  
If you select any of these Grim Hollow heritages, your character is a Humanoid, even if their appearance is radically different from other Humanoids.

### Physical Features
In addition to selecting your heritage traits, you can also decide the general look and appearance of your character. Elves might have a general tendency toward tall, graceful figures, while Dwarves are known for their stout and sturdy forms. But as an adventurer in Etharis, you are anything but typical. Feel free to play an Elf defined by an intimidating physical presence. Play a Dwarf who uses their slender physique to maximum advantage while delving through claustrophobic ruins. In many campaigns, Humans are known for having the widest possible range of coloring and features, but that broad palette of appearance can apply to every heritage in Etharis, common or uncommon.

> Thinking About Traits  
> The traits presented as part of each heritage's write-up are divided into three categories that can help guide your sense of who your character is:
> - Combat traits represent instincts and abilities useful in battle, and when engaging with the myriad other threats of life in Etharis.
> - Exploration traits represent a character's focus on interacting with and traveling through the physical world.
> - Roleplaying traits set up a character's talents and aptitudes with skills, tools, magic, and more.

> When considering the traditional traits for your chosen heritage, consult that section to assess whether the benefits a trait provides fit your character concept—and read through other available traits to get a sense of the many aptitudes, instincts, and innate abilities your character might embrace.

### Trait Selection
In a typical fifth edition game, characters are given a list of traits or features based on their species, ancestry, heritage, or whatever term is used by the source material. If you choose to use that method for your Grim Hollow game, you can do so. Each heritage presented in this chapter features base traits shared by all characters of that heritage, plus eight traditional traits that create a typical member of that heritage. However, a Grim Hollow campaign also allows players to build unique characters built on a diverse range of traits.

Selecting the traditional traits noted for your heritage is quick and easy, and creates a character who feels like a solid archetype within your chosen heritage. But you can swap any of those suggested traditional heritage traits for any of the traits provided, building your character around any eight traits. This can include taking the traditional traits presented for any other heritage, taking one of your traditional traits again to gain its secondary effect, or taking any of the many traits that aren't part of any heritage's default presentation.

> Two Modes of Free Trait Selection  
> Within the Grim Hollow Heritage System, players can experiment with the free choice of heritage traits for characters of any heritage, not just Accursed characters. But a character of a particular heritage built using freeform trait selection is meant to have a vastly different feel to an Accursed character.  
> For example, a Dwarf character can easily eschew all the traditional Dwarf traits. Choosing nothing but traits relating to magic, performance, and movement can create a magnificent Dwarf bard who sets themself apart from any standard Dwarf archetype. Such a Dwarf will absolutely stand out in a campaign—but with the context of feeling different than the Dwarves known to most characters in the world.  
> However, when a player builds an Accursed character, there is no norm for that character to relate to. Accursed characters are wholly unique and alone, disconnected from any of the culture or history that gives even the rare heritages and the other eldritch heritages a common baseline defining their place in the world. Furthermore, other characters in Etharis may treat an Accursed with any mixture of amazement, admiration, or fear, depending on how an Accursed presents and conducts themself.

**Customizing Heritage**  
The world of the Grim Hollow campaign setting is a world of endless conflict, fell magic, and dark secrets. The peoples of the world are divided along clear lines of heritage that are often subdivided by culture or region. But no matter your chosen heritage, your character is also defined by upbringing and circumstance. Have you spent your life in relative peace in the heartland, or in a frontier territory where raids and warfare are a constant threat? Have you or your family line been touched by contemporary magic or an ancient curse? Do you consider yourself an exemplar of your people, or do you quietly push against the social and cultural norms that others expect to define you?

As an adventurer in Etharis, you have even more reason than most to break the expectations that your heritage might hold for you. You might play an Elf who lived among dwarves for years, swapping the default Elf's Shroud of the Wild trait for the Toughness trait. You might play a Grudgel with a magical background, deciding to take the spellcasting granted by 2 and Magical Savant traits in place of the Grudgel's suggested Artisanal Focus and Crafter's Eye traits. You might decide to select four of your suggested traditional traits and take those four traits again, creating a character whose specific focus grants them an edge in the things they're best at. The traditional traits listed for each heritage are only thematic suggestions. How much or how little your heritage's most popular traditions shape your character is up to you.

> Balancing Traits  
> Traditional traits for each of the standard heritages in a Grim Hollow campaign are divided fairly evenly between combat, exploration, and roleplaying, with three traits in two of those categories and two traits in the third category. However, this isn't a specific pattern to which you must adhere.  
> In a Grim Hollow campaign, you can take heritage traits from any of the three trait categories as you see fit, unless the GM determines otherwise. In certain campaigns with a strong focus on combat or exploration, it might make sense for characters to balance their trait selection, choosing at least two traits in each category. But most of the time, allowing free selection of heritage traits allows you to customize your character in a way that best fits the story you want to tell.  
> Sometimes, you might want your heritage traits to provide options that your chosen class doesn't give you. For example, in building a Sorcerer character, you might focus on Combat traits, creating a character who grew up amid conflict, and who trained with weapons, armor, and combat tactics even before their magical power began to assert itself. At other times, you want your heritage traits to reinforce your chosen character concept, as with building a Ranger who focuses on Exploration traits. By creating a foundation of natural capability on which your class can further build, you can shape a character to make them the absolute best at what they do.

## Grim Hollow Heritages
The following sections present the heritages available to players in a Grim Hollow campaign, divided into the three categories of common heritages, rare heritages, and eldritch heritages.

> **Common Heritages**  
> The common heritages of Etharis include the Humans who now rule the continent and the folk of the elder peoples who have been forced to reckon with new lives in lands they once ruled or dominated.  
> **Rare Heritages**  
> Folk of the rare heritages of Etharis have dwelled long in isolation or on the fringes between the lands and cultures of more populous folk. Characters of these heritages face the same struggles as all people, but often possess unique views of the world that others struggle to understand.  
> **Eldritch Heritages**  
> The eldritch heritages of Grim Hollow cover a range of folk shaped by magical intent, unnatural power, or the touch of ancient curses. Almost universally, folk of these heritages are fated to make their way alone through a troubled and dangerous world.

## Heritage Traits
This section presents the heritage traits featured in each of the heritages defined in the previous section. Each of these traits helps shape and define what your character's heritage means for them. Some characters proudly use most or all of the traditional traits presented for their heritage, marking themselves as a solid example of the capabilities and worldview for which that heritage is widely known. Other characters are defined by the unexpected differences between them and other folk of their heritage.

### Traits and Story
When you choose your traits, whether traditional or freely chosen, consider not just what those traits provide your character in terms of game mechanics, but also how your character came to possess those traits. Is a trait something you were born with? Is it a feature that runs in your family, whether a natural inheritance or a long-held familial curse? Is a trait something you came upon later in your life? Did it just happen to you, or was it gained through years of focus and training? Was the trait enabled by magic, or is it naturally occurring?

Whatever the genesis of each of your heritage traits, you should also imagine how those traits have affected—and continue to affect—your life. Does a particular trait set you apart from your kin, or even make you an outcast in your traditional society? Or has it made you more accepted? How has your trait affected the life you've lived, and do folk around you have any reason to react to it, positively or negatively?

The answers to all these questions can help you establish a rich backstory and personality for your character.

### Taking Heritaeg Traits
Taking a heritage trait once establishes a baseline benefit for your character. For example, you can take the Darkvision trait if you want to see in shadow or darkness, the Eager Deceiver trait if you want to have innate proficiency in the Deception skill, and so forth.

You can also take each trait a second time to grant an additional benefit, and many traits can be taken three or more times if they are built around specific choices or options that change each time you take the trait. Taking a trait more than once grants an additional benefit over and above the trait's baseline benefit, improving the baseline benefit in some way. For example, taking the Darkvision trait a second time gives you the Improved Darkvision trait, allowing you to see even farther in the dark.

All rules and limitations that come with a trait the first time you take it apply to the benefit granted by taking the trait again unless the trait specifies otherwise. For example, the Impromptu Artisan trait allows you to craft simple gear as long as you have an appropriate proficiency, raw materials, and necessary equipment. If you take that trait twice, you can craft more complex gear, but the requirements for materials and equipment don't go away.

### Natural or Magical?
With the exception of traits that grant you the ability to cast cantrips or spells, most heritage traits don't specify whether any given trait is natural or magical. This gives you the freedom to decide how the trait has shaped your character.

A Dwarf with the Damage Resistance trait might be possessed of a natural fortitude that lets them shrug off poison damage, while a Dragonborn with that trait carries the legacy of a draconic ancestor to protect them from Fire damage. A Dhampir character whose curse makes their body unnaturally strong has a perfect physical explanation for their Well Protected trait. But a Halfling with a seemingly normal physique might select the same trait to represent some kind of preternatural resilience.

Even traits that specifically focus on defending against magical effects, such as Awakened Mind or Magical Fortification, might be mundane in origin, representing a natural resilience or aptitude powerful enough to interact with magic.

Even if you decide that some or all of your character's traits are magical, those traits remain an intrinsic and natural part of you, fueled by your physical, mental, and spiritual strength. As such, traits to which you give a magical origin can't be dispelled with Dispel Magic and similar effects, and are unaffected by magical dead zones or wild magic zones, the Antimagic Field spell, and so on.

## Trait List
Heritage traits are grouped into three categories: Combat, Exploration, and Roleplaying. Traits of each group are listed below in alphabetical order, along with the name of the improved version of the trait if it is taken more than once. This list includes the traditional traits identified for each of the heritages described in the previous section.
