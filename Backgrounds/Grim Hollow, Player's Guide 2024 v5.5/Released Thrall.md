# Released Thrall

Valikan raiders search for many things: food, goods, weapons, and thralls. You were one of those taken by the clans because you had skills that the clan lacked in their cold northern home. Once you arrived, you were given a choice: join the clan or find your own way home. You chose the latter. You then had to find your way through the cold and dangerous lands of Valikaâ€”and whatever other lands separated you from your home.  
You had to be ever watchful of other threats, hiding when danger presented itself. No place is safe, and you must take every opportunity to advance toward your goals.
