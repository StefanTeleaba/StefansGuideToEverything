# Beggar

Many who fall on hard times have no other option than begging for coppers. Considered the lowest rung of society, you are looked down upon by other members of society, when they bother to notice you at all.  
If you are from a major metropolis of Etharis, you might be much more than you appear. You may act as an informant, spy, distraction, or worseâ€”working right under the noses of those who treat you as part of the scenery. This might make you wealthier than you let on, and people in the know treat you with a modicum of respect and caution.
