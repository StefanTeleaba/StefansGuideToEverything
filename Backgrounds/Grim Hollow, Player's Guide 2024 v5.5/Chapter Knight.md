# Chapter Knight

Knights of the Charneault Kingdom are more than soldiers. You're an exemplar of the virtues that maintain peace and prosperity in the realm. Through training and study, you've dedicated your life to upholding noble ideals such as strength, bravery, charity, temperance, and tradition.  
You shoulder as a coat of arms your commitments to which you're sworn—those of your household or Knight Chapter. If you are still a squire, yet to accomplish your first quest, your shield is blank.  
You might receive many honors during your journeys, though much will be expected of you. Folk may look to you as a protector, leader, or keeper of traditions—or you may be feared as a stern justiciar of the Crown's justice. The path of a knight is difficult and perilous, and not all who walk it maintain their virtues.
