# Scion of the Thaumaturge

You served a mysterious organization simply called the Thaumaturge. You received orders to perform tasks that ranged from the mundane to the inscrutable. Your contact assured you that even if the tasks made no sense, you were serving the greater good of your home, and of all Etharis.  
Your tasks led you to new locations. You secretly met with other members of the organization, and you looked to the stars to give you signs and portents about the future. You may still be performing these tasks, or years may have passed since your last contact, but you know that there are forces beyond understanding that pull on people's strings and make them dance.
