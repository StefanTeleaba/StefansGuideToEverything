# Free Swords Mercenary

Mud, blood, and coin have been your entire life since joining the Company of Free Swords. You may have been recruited from a fighting pit in Unterland, joined as a fugitive to escape justice, or been found as a babe in the mud and raised as a Free Sword. Your history before joining the Company doesn't matter now. Your comrades are your family. Violence is your trade.  
The infantry ranks of the Free Swords live by the unspoken rule of Etharisâ€”it's a place where only the strong survive. Your ambitions may stretch only as far as your payment for enduring the next battle. Few expect anything more from you. Yet a hidden ideal may truly drive your actions, or you may hope to lead your own company one day.
