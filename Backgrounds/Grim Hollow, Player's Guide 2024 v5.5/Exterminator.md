# Exterminator

Etharis is overrun with vermin, but for you those pests of the four-legged variety. In the cities these are generally rats and other rodents. In the country, the pests might come in the form of raccoons or other critters that steal food and destroy structures piece by piece.  
You've trained in the arts of getting pests away from people and coin away from clients. You may run an honest business, helping farmers and shop owners eliminate potentially life-threatening pests. Or you may introduce those pests in the first place, then solve the problem you created, skipping town before your ploy is discovered.
