# Envoy

You are the official representative of a government or other powerful group, traveling to further the objectives of the group you represent. You must be ready at a moment's notice to travel to the next town, or to other parts of the world. Such travel requires not just social skills but also a strong drive and a hardy disposition.  
Your responsibilities change based on the organization you represent and their goals: forge alliances or maintain existing ones, establish business ties, oversee far-ranging projects, etc. However, many of your tasks are reactive: responding to a noble's threats, securing defensive pacts in times of conflict, or bolstering border defenses. Everywhere you go, something is at stake.
