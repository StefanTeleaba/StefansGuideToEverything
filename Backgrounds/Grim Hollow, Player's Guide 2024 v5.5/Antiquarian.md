# Antiquarian

You are fascinated with studying history and identifying ancient artifacts, relics, and texts. You seek to gather rare and lost items to add to your collection or the collections of others.  
Your skill with identifying the properties of artifacts and historical objects makes you an adept problem-solver, especially when ancient relics and languages are involved. Funding expeditions to search for these artifacts is often expensive, meaning you seldom travel without the backing of a wealthy patron or organization. These groups, like the Antiquarians they fund, have motives that range from the beneficent to the sinister. If you diverge from the intended goals of your benefactors, you might find yourself unfunded at best and hunted at worst.
