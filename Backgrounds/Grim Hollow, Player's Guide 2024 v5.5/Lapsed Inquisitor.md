# Lapsed Inquisitor

You spent years traveling the countryside as a member of the Arcanist Inquisition, seeking out heretics and blasphemers, daemons and arcanists. Your work uncovered hidden evil that likely saved the lives of countless innocents. However, on more than one occasion, your or others' zeal brought low innocents.  
After a crisis of conscience, you left the ranks of the inquisitors. Leaving the Inquisition is itself a dangerous prospect, but you could no longer abide. Maybe someone you love and care for was accused falsely or maybe arcane affinities would have led to their destruction. Maybe you are that accused person. Maybe the last investigation you carried out opened your eyes to new realities. Now you are living with a target on your back. Your former peers don't take kindly to people leaving their ranks. Those you persecuted have not forgotten your deeds. But life must still be lived, and there's more than one way to find and destroy the evil in the world.
