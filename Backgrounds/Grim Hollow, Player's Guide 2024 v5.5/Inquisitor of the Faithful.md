# Inquisitor of the Faithful

You are a servant of the Watchers of the Faithful, hunting down heretics and blasphemers within your own faith, cultists of sinister powers, or other threats to your divine order.  
Divine justice does not discriminate, and you have mercilessly punished crimes both mundane and supernaturalâ€”tasks that leave scars both on body and soul.  
You travel far and wide in your role, spreading the rumors of the sinful and the deviant take you. Corruption is just as likely to fester within as without, so you must be ever watchful of those who travel with you. Those found guilty, wherever they hail from and for whatever their reason, must be faced without mercy.
