# Disgraced Raider

You were a raider associated with one of the greatly feared Vaikan clans. The terror you and your allies struck within sailing distance of your homeland was massive and palpable. The risks were great, but the respect was undeniable.  
You lost that respect, however, when something went wrong. Perhaps you lost your nerve and fled the battlefield. Perhaps you lost your mind and killed when you were only supposed to capture. Perhaps you saw the terror you inspired in others as a moral failing rather than a point of honor. Regardless, you were cast out of your clan and could never return. You now travel Etharis having to live with what you've done and the shame (or honor) of your clan's shunning.
