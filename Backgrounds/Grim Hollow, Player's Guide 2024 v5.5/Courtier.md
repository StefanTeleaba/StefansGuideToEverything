# Courtier

You were either born into a role within the courts or power structures of your area, or you worked your way into the company of the powerful or elite through perseverance, skill, trickery, or some combination of those. You draw upon the power of your institutions to gain what you needâ€”but you're always at the mercy of those institutions as well.  
You may have a specialized role within the system, such as a court jester or someone with influence. Or you may occupy a more generic role as a hanger-on, whose role is undefined but whose power rests simply in being connected to someone with the power to get what is needed.
