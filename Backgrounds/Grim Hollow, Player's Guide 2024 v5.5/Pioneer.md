# Pioneer

There is still land in Etharis where no one has lived before, and pioneers are the hardy folk who set out to tame that land for the first time. You've learned to find a suitable area to live, set up the beginnings of a village, build the dwellings needed for settlers, then move on.  
You have weathered punishing storms, migrations, and harsh winters. You and yours have adapted to the environment. Everything you own is built with your own two hands, and your aptitude in working with natural materials has provided you with shelter, tools, and clothing.
