# Lightning Strikes
*Deadly Hazard (Levels 5–10)*

Whenever an area of the Calim Desert is subjected to both strong wind and heavy precipitation (see the Calim Desert Weather table), there is a 25 percent chance a lightning storm forms. Creatures within the area of such a storm are at risk of lightning strikes.  
A lightning storm lasts for 1 hour. After each minute spent in the area of a lightning storm, a creature rolls 1d6; on a 1, lightning streaks down to strike the creature. The creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
***Detecting Lightning Storms.*** A creature that succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check predicts a lightning storm 1d4 hours before it forms in the vicinity.
