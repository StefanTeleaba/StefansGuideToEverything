# Glittermoss
*Deadly Hazard (Levels 5–10) or Nuisance Hazard (Levels 11–16)*

Intense fields of unstable magic can produce a sparkling, multicolored moss called glittermoss. A patch of glittermoss covers a 5-foot square. Glittermoss is often found near communal telepathy zones (see earlier in this chapter), though it doesn't grow in direct sunlight.  
A creature that comes into contact with glittermoss makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 11 (2d10) Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition. While Blinded in this way, the creature is illuminated by glittering spores and sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
Glittermoss spores can leap to nearby creatures. While an affected creature is Blinded due to glittermoss, any creature that starts its turn within the Bright Light the affected creature sheds makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
Any amount of Fire or Necrotic damage destroys a patch of glittermoss instantly.
