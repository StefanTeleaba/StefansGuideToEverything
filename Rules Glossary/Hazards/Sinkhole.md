# Sinkhole
*Nuisance Hazard (Levels 1–4)*

Sinkholes occur when sand fills the top half of a large cavity in rock or other hard earth. When a creature steps onto the sand, the ground collapses down into the bottom half of the cavity, injuring those caught in the sinkhole and leaving them stranded below the surface.  
As a Search action, a creature can detect a sinkhole with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Once a sinkhole is spotted, it can usually be avoided by moving around it.  
A creature that walks onto a sinkhole must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check or fall 10 feet to the bottom of the sinkhole. A creature without a Climb Speed can climb out of the sinkhole with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.  
***At Higher Levels.*** You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the sinkhole's depth, as shown in the following table.
| Levels | Sinkhole Depth |
|:------:|----------------|
| 5–10   | 30 feet        |
| 11–16  | 60 feet        |
| 17–20  | 120 feet       |
