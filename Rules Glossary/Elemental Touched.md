# Elemental Touched
*Homebrew*

You harbor a wellspring of elemental energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Elemental Energy Points. You have a number of these points equal to two times your level.  
You can expend these points to fuel certain powers.  
When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.
