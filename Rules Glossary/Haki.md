# Haki
*Homebrew*  
Your experience on the battlefield has refined your fighting techniques. You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called Haki Dice.

## Level 3: Haki
***Maneuvers.*** Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.  
***Haki Dice.*** You have four Haki Dice, which are d8s. A Haki Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Haki Dice when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You gain an additional Haki Die when you reach levels 7 (five dice total) and 15 (six dice total).
***Saving Throws.*** If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) and Proficiency Bonus.

## Level 10: Improved Haki
Your Haki Die becomes a d10.

## Level 15: Relentless
Once per turn, when you use a maneuver, you can roll 1d8 and use the number rolled instead of expending a Haki Die.

## Level 18: Ultimate Combat Haki
Your Haki Die becomes a d12.

### Maneuver Options

#### Observation Haki
***Precision Attack.*** When you miss with an attack roll, you can expend one Haki Die, roll that die, and add it to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit.  
***Parry.*** When a creature hits you with an attack, you can take a Reaction to add one Haki Die to your Armor Class, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You gain this bonus to your AC against attacks until the start of your next turn.

#### Armament Haki
***Harden.*** When another creature damages you with a melee attack roll, you can take a Reaction and expend one Haki Die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your Haki Die plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).  
***Enhanced Attack.*** When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend one Haki Die and add the die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Conqueror's Haki
***Menacing Attack.*** When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Haki Die to attempt to incapacitate the target. Add the Haki Die to the attack's damage roll. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target has the Incapacitated condition. If the saving throw fails by 10 or more, the target has the Paralyzed condition. If the saving throw fails by 15 or more, the target has the Unconscious condition.  
***Intimidationg Presence.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks to strike terror into orthers. When you do so, you expend one Haki Die and each creature of your choice in a 15-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target has the Incapacitated condition. If the saving throw fails by 10 or more, the target has the Paralyzed condition. If the saving throw fails by 15 or more, the target has the Unconscious condition.  
The area increases to a 20-foot Emanation when you reach level 15 and to a 30-foot Emanation when you reach level 20.
