# Gunslinger
*The Gunslinger Class: Valda's Spire of Secrets*  

Risk is in a Gunslinger's blood. They are bold renegades, bucking tradition and forging a new path with dangerous and inelegant firearms. Gunslingers are infamous for surviving by their wits and relying on split-second timing and a considerable amount of luck to survive.  
**Guts and Gunpowder**  
Black powder isn't for the faint of heart. Its thunderous applause is volatile and impreciseâ€”a barely controlled explosion directed at an enemy. Only the truly fearless seek to master it. But Gunslingers have nerves of steel, hurling death from their guns in a roaring cacophony. Adapted for shootouts, gunslingers are mobile and daring, knowing that life or death hangs on snap decision-making and one's own mettle.  
**Dangerous Outsiders**  
A Gunslinger's explosive lifestyle lends well to wandering and adventuring. Gunslingers often shoot first and ask questions later, an attitude which earns them few friends and bountiful enemies. In their travels, most gunslingers are secretive and take great lengths to go unnoticed, lest they be spotted by old foes with scores to settle.

## Level 1: Fighting Style
You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice. If you choose a feat, such as Great Weapon Fighting, that requires you to hold a Melee weapon in one or two hands, you can use that feat with Ranged weapons.  
Whenever you gain a Gunslinger level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

## Level 1: Quick Draw
You're adept at drawing and firing before others have time to react, granting you the following benefits.  
***Initiative.*** You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.  
***Double Draw.*** You can draw or stow two weapons that lack Two-Handed when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.  

## Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Ranged weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.  
When you reach certain Gunslinger levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Gunslinger Features table.

## Level 2: Critical Shot
Your attack rolls with Ranged weapons can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.  
At Gunslinger level 9, your attack rolls with Ranged weapons score a Critical Hit on a roll of 18-20. At Gunslinger level 17, they score a Critical Hit on a roll of 17-20.

## Level 2: Risk
You can perform incredible feats of daring fueled by special dice called Risk Dice.

***Risk Dice.*** You have four Risk Dice, which are d8s. A Risk Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Risk Dice when you finish a Short or Long Rest. Your Risk Die changes and more Risk Dice become available as shown on the Risk Dice column of the Gunslinger Features table.

***Maneuvers.*** You can expend Risk Dice to perform maneuvers. Your maneuver options are detailed later in the class description.

***Saving Throws.*** If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

### Maneuver Options

***Bite the Bullet.*** As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Risk Die to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the number rolled on the die plus your Gunslinger level.

***Blindfire.*** You can take a Bonus Action and expend one Risk Die to gain Blindsight with a range of 30 feet until the end of the current turn.

***Dodge Roll.*** You can expend one Risk Die as a Bonus Action to move up to 15 feet and reload any Ranged weapon you are holding. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks and is unaffected by Difficult Terrain.

***Grazing Shot.*** When you miss with a ranged attack roll using a weapon, you can expend one Risk Die (no action required) to deal damage to that creature equal to a roll of the die plus your Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1). This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier. You can only use this maneuver once per turn.

***Maverick Spirit.*** When you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma ability check or saving throw, you can expend one Risk Die to add it to the roll, potentially turning it into a success. You can only use this maneuver once per turn.

***Skin of Your Teeth.*** When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction and expend one Risk Die to dodge out of harm's way. Roll the die and add the number rolled to your AC against this attack, potentially causing it to miss.

## Level 3: Gunslinger Subclass
You gain a Gunslinger subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Gunslinger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Gunslinger level or lower.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Level 5: Gut Shot
Whenever you score a Critical Hit against a Large or smaller creature with a ranged attack using a weapon, the projectile lodges itself in the target. For 1 minute or until the target replaces one of its attacks with dislodging the projectile, its Speed is halved and it has Disadvantage on attack rolls.

## Level 6: Subclass Feature
You gain a feature from your Gunslinger Subclass.

## Level 7: Evasion
When you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.  
You don't benefit from this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.
