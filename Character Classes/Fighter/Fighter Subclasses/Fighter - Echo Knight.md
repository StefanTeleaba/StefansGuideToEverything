A mysterious and feared frontline warrior of the Kryn Dynasty, the Echo Knight has mastered the art of using dunamis to summon the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.

## Level 3: Manifest Echo
You can use a Bonus Action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. It is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a Bonus Action, until you manifest another echo, or until you have the Incapacitated condition.  
Your echo is considered an object, but uses your game statistics, except it has an Armor Class equal to 12 plus your Constitution modifier, 1 Hit Point, and Immunity to all conditions. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move in any direction. If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. As a Bonus Action, magically swap places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.  
When you take the Attack action, any attack you make can originate from your space or the echo's space. You make this choice for each attack. When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your Reaction to make an Opportunity Attack against that creature as if you were in the echo's space.

## Level 3: Unleash Incarnation
You can heighten your echo's fury. Whenever you take the Attack action, you can make one additional attack from the echo's position. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 7: Echo Avatar
You can temporarily transfer your consciousness to your echo. As an action, you can see through your echo's eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you have the Deafened and Blinded conditions. This effect lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it early (no action required). While using this feature, your echo can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without it being destroyed.

# Level 10: Shadow Martyr
You can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your Reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The attack roll that triggered the Reaction is instead made against your echo. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

# Level 15: Reclaim Potential
You've learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

# Level 18: Legion of One
Your summoning powers have grown more potent.  
***Endless Echoes.*** When you roll Initiative and are missing any uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature, you regain one use of it.  
***Double Up.*** You can use a Bonus Action to create two echos with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can co-exist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo's position can be done from the other's instead.
