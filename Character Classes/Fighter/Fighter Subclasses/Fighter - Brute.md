Brutes are simple warriors who rely on mighty attacks and their own durability to overcome their enemies. Some brutes combine this physical might with tactical cunning. Others just hit things until those things stop hitting back.

## Level 3: Brute Force
When you make an attack — with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike — and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Fighter, as shown on the Brute Die table.

**Brute Die**
| Fighter Level | Die Size |
|---------------|----------|
| 3             | 1d6      |
| 3             | 1d8      |
| 3             | 1d10     |
| 3             | 1d12     |

## Level 7: Brutish Durability
Your toughness allows you to shrug off assaults that would devastate others. When you make a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a Brute Die to your roll. Moreover, when this would bring your total on a Death Saving Throw to 20 or above, you gain the benefit of rolling a 20 on it.

## Level 10: Additional Fighting Style
You gain another Fighting Style feat of your choice.

## Level 15: Devastating Critical
When you score a Critical Hit, the target takes extra damage of the weapon's type equal to your Fighter level.

## Level 18: Survivor
You attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle, giving you these benefits.  
***Defy Death.*** You have Advantage on Death Saving Throws.  
***Heroic Rally.*** At the start of each of your turns, you regain Hit Points equal to 5 plus your Constitution modifier if you are Bloodied and have at least 1 Hit Point.
