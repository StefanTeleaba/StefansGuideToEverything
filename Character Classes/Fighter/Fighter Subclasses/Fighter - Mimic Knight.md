# Mimic Knight
[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  
*v2.1*  

You have magically bonded with a mimic, a shapeshifting monster with a habit for disguising itself as inanimate objects. Through your training, it serves as your weapon, armor or shield - alive and deadly. Together, you adapt, deceive and strike with cunning.

## Level 3: Mimic Companion
You have trained your mimic to take the form of your armaments instead of acting on its own.  
***Devour Item.*** Over the course of a Short or Long Rest, the mimic can devour one piece of non-magical equipment. The item must be a Simple or Martial melee weapon, a Shield, or a suit of armor, and is destroyed in the process. Thereafter, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, the mimic can take the form of one of the objects it has previously devoured, granting the corresponding benefits below while you have it equipped.  
***Magic Mimicry.*** The mimic can also devour a magical version of one of the above listed items. Rather than destroying the magic item, it temporarily merges with your mimic. The item is harmlessly regurgitated if the mimic devours another one, if it is destroyed or if you die. While your mimic is transformed into an item of the same category as the devoured magic item, it gains the item’s magical properties, even if it isn’t the same kind of weapon or armor.  
***Mimic’s Bite.*** In certain situations (described below), your mimic is able to bite a target. Choose Acid or Piercing damage. The target takes 1d6 damage of the chosen type. This damage increases to 2d6 when you reach level 15 in this class.  
***Re-spawn.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can summon a new mimic, which knows all of the mundane forms that the previous one did. If you already have a mimic from this feature, the old one is destroyed when the new one appears.

**Weapon**  
***Weapon Shift.*** Immediately before you make an attack roll using the mimic, you can command it to take the shape of another devoured weapon (no action required).  
***Mimic Mastery.*** Practice with your shifting weapon allows you to prepare an additional Weapon Mastery, which you can only use when attacking with the mimic.  
***Bite.*** Once per turn, you can use your Mimic’s Bite when you hit a target with an attack roll using the mimic.

**Armor and Shield**  
***Sticky Grasp.*** When you make an Unarmed Strike and take the Grapple option, you can do so without needing a free hand. You can only Grapple one creature in this way at a time per mimic with this feature.  
***Bite.*** When a creature starts its turn Grappled by you, you can use your Mimic’s Bite on it.  
***Engulfing Form (Armor Only).*** You can don and doff the armor as a Utilize action. In addition, a creature Grappled by your Sticky Grasp has Disadvantage on ability checks made to escape the Grapple.  
***Quick Grasp (Shield Only).*** You can take a Bonus Action to use your Shield’s Sticky Grasp.

## Level 3: Mundane Mimicry
As an action, you can command your mimic to temporarily replicate the form of a Small or Tiny object you can see within 30 feet of you. The mimic appears like a near-perfect imitation of that object for 1 hour or until you command it to return to its normal form (no action required). Its true nature can be discerned by a creature who succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check by taking the Study action. The DC equals 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
If a creature touches the mimic for the first time on a turn or starts its turn touching it while it’s in this state, you can use your Mimic’s Bite on it.

## Level 7: Adhesive Form
While you have your mimic equipped, you gain a benefit:  
***Reactive Grasp (Shield).*** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can take a Reaction to use your Shield’s Sticky Grasp against the attacker.  
***Reposition (Weapon).*** When you hit a Large or smaller creature with the mimic, you can move the target horizontally to an unoccupied space within your reach.  
***Sticky Shell (Armor).*** You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed and can climb difficult surfaces, even ceilings, while keeping your hands free and without needing to make an ability check.

## Level 10: Monstrous Offspring
Your mimic has spawned an offspring. You now have two mimics, and can equip each of them separately. The second mimic follows the same rules as the original and can turn into all the same forms the original can, but merges with magic items separately.

## Level 15: Mimic Spawning
You always have the Animate Objects spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Constitution. When you cast the spell, you create mimics in the form of objects you choose in unoccupied spaces within the spell’s range, instead of animating existing objects, which vanish when the spell ends.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 18: Unbreakable Adhesive
You gain the following benefits.  
***No Escape.*** When a creature Grappled by you Teleports or is forcefully moved away from you, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw against your Unarmed Strike DC. On a failure, you maintain the Grapple and travel with the target.  
***Ensnare.*** When a creature succeeds on a D20 Test to avoid or escape being Grappled by you, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to cause it to fail instead and take Acid damage equal to 1d6 + half your Fighter level.
