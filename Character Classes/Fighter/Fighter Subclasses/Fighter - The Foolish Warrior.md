*v1.0*  

*Stumble through Combat With Incredible Luck*  
Foolish Warriors obliviously breeze through combat with extraordinary luck, barely dodging out of the way of hazards and stumbling into successful maneuvers. This luck may be supernatural in nature, the result of some blessing or curse, or perhaps your foolish warrior just has random chance on their side.

## Level 3: Lucky Break
You have a wellspring of luck, called Lucky Breaks.  
***Uses.*** You have three Lucky Breaks. You gain one more use when you reach levels 7, 10, and 15 in this class. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
***Lucky Break DC.*** Some of your features use your Lucky Break DC, which is equal to 8 plus your Proficiecny Bonus and your Constitution modifier.  
***Lucky Break Die.*** Some of your features use your Lucky Break die, which is a d6.

## Level 3: Unexpectedly Elusive
You have an oddly potent knack for avoiding unseen threats. You have Advantage on saving throws against traps, and creatures do not gain Advantage on attacks against you from the Blinded or Invisible conditions.  
In addition, when you are hit by an attack, you can expend a Lucky Break to roll your Lucky Break die and subtract the result from the attack roll, potentially turning it into a miss, as you stumble out of harm’s way.

## Level 3: Accidental Strike
Sometimes when you fumble a weapon attack, the event cascades into your enemies being harmed anyway. For example, an errant arrow might ricochet around a room and cause a light fixture to fall on an enemy.  
Once per turn when you miss with a weapon attack, you can expend a Lucky Break to force one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Lucky Break DC. On a failure, the creature takes Piercing, Bludgeoning, or Slashing damage (your choice) equal to one roll of your Lucky Break die plus your Fighter level.

## Level 7: Fumblemaker
Your good fortune has evolved to become your enemies’ misfortune. When a creature misses you with an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to expend a Lucky Break and inadvertently cause the enemy to fumble. Choose one of the following effects to occur:  
***Stuck.*** The attacker’s weapon or ammunition gets embedded in the ground or some other element of the environment within 5 feet of you. Once on its turn, a creature within 5 feet of the object can attempt to retrieve it by making a Strength (Althetics) check against your Lucky Break DC. On a failure, the object remains stuck in place.  
***Slip.*** The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw against your Lucky Break DC. On a failure, it has the Prone condition, and it cannot stand up until the start of its next turn.  
***Whoops.*** The creature rolls the attack again, but targets a different creature of your choice within the weapon’s range, as the attack ricochets , it overshoots its swing, or some other unlikely series of events occurs.

## Level 10: Brave Flail
You have become well acustomed to facing threats that are well above your pay grade, and have learned a clever trick to calm your nerves in the face of extreme danger.  
As a Bonus Action, you can shut your eyes tightly for 1 minute. You have the Blinded condition, and while Blinded in this way you gain the following benefits:
- You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions.
- You do not suffer Disadvantage on attacks due to the Blinded condition, and you have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- You add your Lucky Break die to the damage rolls of your weapon attacks.

You can end this effect at any time by opening your eyes (no action required). Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 15: Incredible Luck
Your luck magnifies, granting you the following benefits:  
***Lucky Break Die Improvement.*** Your Lucky Break die becomes a d8.  
***Overflowing Luck.*** When you are in Initiative and roll a 1 or a 20 on a D20 Test, you regain one expended Lucky Break.

## Level 18: Accidental Success
Whenever you roll for a D20 Test and roll a 1 on the d20, you can expend one Lucky Break to turn it into a 20. You do not regain a Lucky Break from your Incredible Luck feature when you do so.
