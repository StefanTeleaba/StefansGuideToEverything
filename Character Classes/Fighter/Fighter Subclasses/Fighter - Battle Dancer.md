*Incorporate Grace and Style into Combat*  
Battle Dancers bring style and grace to combat by incorporating intricate dances into their fighting. These dances have been passed down for many generations, promoting swift and elegant movements for enhanced mobility and self-defense. The skills and techniques gained from learning these traditions have led Battle Dancers to become the premiere combatants of the two-weapon fighting style. They maneuver their ornate pairs of weapons with precision and deadly purpose.

## Level 3: Gifted Performer
You are a graceful and captivating dancer. You gain proficiency in the Performance skill and when you make a Charisma (Performance) check to perform a dance, you have Expertise with the check. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in either Acrobatics, Athletics, or Sleight of Hand (your choice).

## Level 3: Battle Dance
You have learned a specialized dance to perform in combat. When you start your turn you can begin Battle Dancing (no action required) for 1 minute. When you start dancing, and at the start of each of your turns, choose one of the following Choreographies to perform, which lasts until the start of your next turn. These benefits refer to your Dancer’s die, which is a d4.  
***Evasive Steps.*** Roll your Dancer’s die. You gain a bonus to your AC and your Dexterity saving throws equal to the number rolled.  
***Spinning Strikes.*** You add your Dancer’s die to the damage rolls of your melee attacks. You can do so no more than once per action, Bonus Action or Reaction used to make an attack.  
***Swift Travelling.*** Roll your Dancer’s die. On your turn you can Move an additional number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled.  
You cannot perform this dance if you are wearing Heavy Armor, wielding a Shield or wielding a weapon with the Heavy property, and the dance ends early if you don Heavy Armor or equip a Heavy weapon or Shield. The dance also ends early if you have Restrained or Incapacitated conditions.  
You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 7: Dancer's Flourish
As a Bonus Action, you can perform an elaborate flourish, knocking a creature within 5 feet of you off-balance. When you do so, make an attack against the target with an Unarmed Strike or a weapon with the Light property. If the attack hits, you can active the Push or Topple Mastery property even if you’re using another Mastery property with that weapon or Unarmed Strike.  
You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Battle Dance Improvement
Your Battle Dance improves in the following ways:  
***Dancer’s Die Improvement.*** Your Dancer’s die becomes a d6.  
***Fancy Footwork.*** While your Battle Dance is active, you do not provoke Opportunity Attacks from creatures you have hit with a weapon attack this turn.

## Level 15: Footloose
When you roll for Initiative and have no uses of Battle Dance remaining, you regain one use.  
In addition, while your Battle Dance is active, you now choose two Choreographies to perform at the start of each of your turns, instead of one.

## Level 18: Energized Finale
In moments of great intensity, you can cause your dance to explode into a fervor of energetic, yet precise movements. When you use Action Surge, you gain two additional Bonus Actions you can use on that turn.
