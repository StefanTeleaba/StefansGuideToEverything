*Deploy Magical Effects Through Enchanted Ammunition*  
An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. The first Arcane Archers stood watch over their communities and used magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders. Over the centuries, other species have learned this method of blending magical aptitude with archery. These archers have broadened this method’s application to ranged weapons of many kinds and to aspects of adventuring life outside of combat.

## Level 3: Arcane Archer Lore
You learn magical theory and secrets of nature, granting you the following benefits.  
***Cantrip.*** You know either the Druidcraft or Prestidigitation cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.  
***Skills.*** You gain proficiency in the Arcana and Nature skills. If you already have one of these proficiencies, you instead gain proficiency in a different skill of your choice (or with two other skills if you have both).

## Level 3: Arcane Shot
You learn to unleash special magical effects with your shots.  
***Arcane Shot Options.*** You learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice from the “Arcane Shot Options” section later in this subclass’s description.  
You learn an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach Fighter levels 7, 10, 15, and 18. Each time you learn a new Arcane Shot option, you can also replace one option you know with a different one.  
***Using Arcane Shot.*** Once per turn when you make a ranged attack using a weapon with the Ammunition property, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that attack. You decide to use the option when you hit a creature and deal damage to it unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
***Arcane Shot Die.*** Arcane Shot options refer to your Arcane Shot Die. Your Arcane Shot Die is a d6.  
***Saving Throws.*** If an Arcane Shot option requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Intelligence modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
***At Higher Levels.*** Your Arcane Shot Die changes when you reach certain Fighter levels. The die becomes a d8 at level 10, a d10 at level 15, and a d12 at level 18.

## Level 7: Curving Shot
You learn how to direct an errant shot toward a new target. If you make an attack roll with a weapon with the Ammunition property and miss, you can cause the shot to ricochet toward a new target as a Bonus Action immediately after the attack misses. The new target must be a creature you can see within the weapon’s range and within 60 feet of the attack’s original target. Make an attack roll against the new target.

## Level 7: Magical Ammunition
You learn to imbue your ammunition with magical properties. As a Magic action, you can imbue a piece of nonmagical ammunition with one of the following magical properties and fire it at a solid surface you can see within the weapon’s range. On a hit, the ammunition’s effect activates, and the ammunition attaches to the surface it hit for the duration of the effect; when the effect ends, the ammunition is destroyed.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also restore your use of this feature by expending a use of your Second Wind (no action required).  
***Darkening Shot.*** Magical shadows fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from the ammunition for 1 minute. Nonmagical flames in the Emanation are extinguished, and creatures in the Emanation have a –5 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks and Passive Perception.  
***Unlocking Shot.*** A burst of magic fills a 15-foot Emanation originating from the ammunition. A loud knock, audible up to 300 feet away, also emits from the ammunition. Any object in the Emanation that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.  
***Vine Shot.*** A 60-foot-long vine grows from the ammunition. You and other creatures can then climb it. The vine withers away after 10 minutes.

## Level 10: Ever-Ready Shot
When you roll Initiative, you can regain one expended use of Arcane Shot.

## Level 15: Arcane Burst
You can push creatures away from you with your arcane mastery. When you use Indomitable, each creature of your choice in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Arcane Shot DC or be pushed up to 20 feet straight away from you.

## Level 18: Masterful Shots
You employ agility in your sharpshooting. When a creature you can see misses you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to move up to half your Speed away from the attacker without provoking Opportunity Attacks. You can then make a ranged attack roll against the attacker as part of this Reaction if the attacker is within the weapon’s range.

### Arcane Shot Options
The Arcane Shot options are presented here in alphabetical order.

***Banishing Shot.*** Your ammunition temporarily sequesters your target in a harmless demiplane. The creature you hit takes additional Psychic damage equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die and must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished, the creature has the Incapacitated condition and a Speed of 0. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

***Beguiling Shot.*** Your ammunition beguiles your target. The creature you hit takes additional Psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the start of your next turn, treating either you or one of your allies within 30 feet of the target (your choice) as the charmer. The Charmed condition ends early if the charmer attacks the target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

***Bursting Shot.*** You imbue your ammunition with explosive force energy. Immediately after you deal damage to the creature, your target and each creature within a 10-foot Emanation originating from the target take Force damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die.

***Enfeebling Shot.*** Your ammunition saps your target’s strength. The creature you hit takes additional Necrotic damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Poisoned condition until the end of its next turn. Whenever a target Poisoned in this way hits with an attack roll, it subtracts an amount equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die from the total damage of that attack.

***Grasping Shot.*** Your ammunition creates clutching brambles around your target. The creature you hit takes additional Slashing damage equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute or until you use this option again. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot DC, removing the brambles and ending the Restrained condition on the target on a successful check.

***Piercing Shot.*** You give your ammunition an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the ammunition shoots forward in a 30-foot Line that is 1 foot wide, originating from you, then vanishes. The Line ignores cover, as the ammunition phases through solid objects. Each creature in the Line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit plus additional Piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

***Seeking Shot.*** Your ammunition can seek out a target. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the last minute. The ammunition flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring Half Cover and Three-Quarters Cover. If the target is within your weapon’s long range, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit plus additional Force damage equal to two rolls of your Arcane Shot Die, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. If the target is beyond your weapon’s long range, the ammunition disappears after traveling as far as it can.

***Shadow Shot.*** Your ammunition occludes your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature you hit takes additional Psychic damage equal to one roll of your Arcane Shot Die, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

## Level 3: Arcane Archer Lore
You learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature – typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You have proficiency in the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you learn the Prestidigitation or Druidcraft cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier for it.

## Level 3: Arcane Shot
You learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. You learn two Arcane Shots of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below). You learn an extra Arcane Shot of your choice when you reach level 7, and again at level 10, at level 15, and level 18. The damage of all Arcane Shots increases at level 10 and level 18.

When you use the Attack action and you hit a creature with a ranged weapon, you can activate one of your Arcane Shots. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest.

## Level 7: Magic Shot
You gain the ability to infuse your projectiles with magic.

***Infused Shots.*** Whenever you attack with a ranged weapon, you can choose to deal the weapon’s damage type or Force damage.

***Curved Shots.*** When you attack with a ranged weapon and miss, you can use your Reaction to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

## Level 15: Ever-Ready Shot
If you roll Initiative and are missing any uses of your Arcane Shot, you regain one use of it.

### Arcane Shot Options
If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence Modifier.

***Banishing Shot.*** You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The target must succeed on a Charisma save or be banished. While banished in this way, its Speed is 0, and it has the Incapacitated condition. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. At level 10, the target also takes an extra 2d6 Force damage when the arrow hits it. This damage increases to 3d6 at level 18.

***Beguiling Shot.*** Your enchantment magic causes this projectile to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target takes an extra 2d6 Psychic damage and makes a Wisdom save. On a failed save, it has the Charmed condition until the start of your next turn, with the chosen ally as the source. The Psychic damage increases by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).

***Bursting Shot.*** You imbue the projectile with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. It detonates after it hits or misses the target. The target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 3d6 Force damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. The Force damage increases by 2d6 at level 10 (5d6) and at level 18 (7d6).

***Enfeebling Shot.*** You weave necromantic magic into your projectile. The target takes an extra 2d6 Necrotic damage and makes a Constitution save. On a failed save, all damage dealt by the target is halved. The Necrotic damage increases by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).

***Grasping Shot.*** When this projectile strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The target takes an extra 2d6 Poison damage and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet. The first time it moves on its turn without teleporting, it takes 2d6 Slashing damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength save. On a success, the effect ends. The brambles last for 1 minute, until you use it again, or if the target manages to escape early. The Poison damage and Slashing damage both increase by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).

***Piercing Shot.*** You use transmutation magic to give your projectile an ethereal quality. The target takes an extra 3d6 Piercing damage. After the projectile hits or misses the target it continues flying in a 30-foot Line, passing through objects and ignoring cover. Each creature in that Line must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 3d6 Piercing damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. The Piercing damage increases by 2d6 at level 10 (5d6) and at level 18 (7d6).

***Seeking Shot.*** Using divination magic, you grant your projectile the ability to seek out your target, allowing it to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 Force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location. The Force damage increases by 2d6 at level 10 (5d6) and at level 18 (7d6).

***Shadow Shot.*** You weave illusion magic into your projectile, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows. The target takes an extra 2d6 Psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom save or have the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn. The Psychic damage increases by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).
