# Hero
*Cthulhu by Torchlight v5.5*

*“In times as dark as these, all it takes is one spark to bring back the light.” — Hector Arghast, Champion of Ten Banners*

*Entities of the Cthulhu Mythos are terrifyingly implacable and utterly inhuman. While those traits often make such creatures unbeatable, their inability to understand humanity's capabilities can prove their undoing. Heroes are Fighters who bring out the best in humanity. They are the beacons of hope rallying commoners against a shared threat. While their blades are deadly to their enemies, their words are encouragement to their allies, and their unflappable demeanor allows their companions to find the courage and strength they never knew they had.*

## Level 3: Bolstering Presence
At the start of your turn, you can bolster your allies (no action required). Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 2d6 plus half your Fighter level (rounded down). You can't use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Heroic Effort
You can seize the moment and turn the tide. You can take a Reaction at the end of a creature's turn to move up to your Speed and make one attack with a weapon or Unarmed Strike. Then one ally of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you can also move up to its Speed and make one attack with a weapon or Unarmed Strike using its Reaction.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 7: Lead by Example
If you are Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned when you use your Heroic Effort feature, the condition ends on you. In addition, if the ally you target with Heroic Effort is Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned, the condition ends on it.

## Level 10: Inspiring Presence
When you use your Bolstering Presence feature, each of the chosen creatures gains a bonus to D20 Tests and damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) until the end of your next turn.

## Level 15: Durable Presence
When you use your Bolstering Presence feature, each of the chosen creatures gains a bonus to D20 Tests and damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) until the end of your next turn.

## Level 18: Mighty Effort
When you use your Heroic Effort feature, you can now target up to two additional creatures, instead of only one.
