## Level 3: Steady Aim
You gain the following benefits.  
***Bypass Cover.*** Your ranged attacks with weapons ignore Half Cover and Three-Quarters Cover.  
***Long Shots.*** Attacking at long range doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with Ranged weapons.  
***Precision Attacks.*** When you take the Attack action, you can choose to enter a focus state, gaining the following benefits until the start of your next turn. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon and deal damage to the target, the target takes extra damage of the weapon's type equal to half your Fighter level (rounded up).  
You can use this feature four times. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
You gain an additional use when you reach Fighter levels 7 (five uses total) and 15 (six uses total).

## Level 7: Careful Eyes
You gain the following features.  
***Keen Observer.*** Choose one of the following skills: Insight, Investigation, or Perception. If you lack proficiency with the chosen skill, you gain proficiency in it, and if you already have proficiency in it, you gain Expertise in it.  
***Quick Search.*** You can take the Search action as a Bonus Action.

## Level 10: Close-Quarters Shooting
You gain the following benefits.  
***Firing in Melee.*** Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with Ranged weapons.

## Level 15: Rapid Strike
You learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. Once per turn, if you make an attack and have Advantage on it, you can forgo the Advantage for that roll to make an additional attack against that target as part of the same action, Bonus Action or Reaction.

## Level 18: Snap Shot
During the first round of each combat, if you take the Attack action and make a ranged attack with a weapon, you can make an additional ranged attack as part of the same action.
