# Dungeoneer
*Valda's Spire of Secrets: Player Pack*

*Survive the Dungeon*  

*Only fools would dive headfirst into an abandoned crypt filled with monsters and deathtraps, but it seems only fools emerge from such crypts laden with as much loot as they can carry. The archetypal dungeon delver is a veteran of such suicidal dungeon delves, and has become intimately familiar with the hazards therein. In the course of their adventures, such a Dungeoneer will have adopted countless best practices, along with a litany of unproven superstitions which they believe keeps them alive. Principles from "always be the first one to hit the monster" to "never be the first one to touch a treasure chest" line a Dungeoneer's journal. However, it's probably better to be paranoid and superstitious than lying at the bottom of a pit trap, incinerated by a Fireball, or digested by a mimic.*

## Level 3: Kick in the Door
You have Advantage attack rolls you make during the first round of combat.

## Level 3: Heroic Superstition
You gain Heroic Inspiration when you do any of the following.  
***Damage Vulnerability.*** Deal a type of damage to which a creature has Vulnerability.  
***Find Weakness.*** Trigger a creature's specific weakness, such as Shadow's Sunlight Weakness or dealing damage that prevents a creature's Regeneration.  
***Guess the Monster.*** Guess a creature's specific kind (such as a mimic or lich) before seeing it. The GM confirms if you are correct when the creature is revealed. You can't guess the identity of Humanoids.  
***Secret Doors.*** Discover a secret door.  
***Trapfinder.*** Detect or disarm a trap.  
***Treasure Hoard.*** Find an Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, or Legendary magic item or treasure worth 100 GP+.  

## Level 7: Dungeon Precautions
You can cast any of the following spells without a spell slot: Alarm, Comprehend Languages, Detect Magic, Detect Poison and Disease, Find Traps, Identify, and Purify Food and Drink. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this feature (choose the ability when you cast the spell).  
You can use this feature five times and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Monster Kill
Once per turn when you hit an Aberration, Dragon, Fey, Fiend, Monstrosity, Ooze, or Undead with an attack with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d10 damage to the target. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon.

## Level 15: Avoidance
When you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can't use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition.

## Level 18: Veteran Hero
Your dungeoneering expertise gives you the following benefits.  
***Peerless Heroism.*** Once per turn when you make a D20 Test, you can expend Heroic Inspiration to turn the roll into a 20, instead of rerolling the d20.  
***Double Inspiration.*** You can have two instances of Heroic Inspiration at one time. You can use only one Heroic Inspiration per roll.
