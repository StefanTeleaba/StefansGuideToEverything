[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  
*v1.0*  

Kinetic Knights channel evocation magic into their weapons to manipulate the potential energy within, and release that energy to cause their weaponry to erupt in highly destructive explosions. Whether you studied the arcane to attain this power or were simply born with it, your explosive powers are a force to be reckoned with.

## Level 3: Motion Manipulation
You can convert some of the potential energy in matter that you touch into kinetic energy, increasing its speed. You gain the following benefits:  
***Speed Boost.*** As a Bonus Action, you can touch a willing creature and increase its Speed by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.  
***Accelerate Projectile.*** When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, its normal and long ranges both increase by 15 feet for that attack.

## Level 3: Kinetic Charge
Once per turn when you make an attack with a weapon, you can imbue the weapon or its ammunition with explosive energy, changing its damage type to Force. Immediately after the attack hits or misses, you can create one of the following effects.  
These effects use your Kinetic DC, which is equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency Bonus.  
***Kinetic Explosion.*** The target and each creature within 5 feet of it, other than you, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take Force damage equal to 1d6 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 damage), or half as much on a success.  
***Pushing Blast.*** The target and each creature within 5 feet of it, other than you, must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from the weapon or projectile. A Huge or larger creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.  
You can use this feature 3 times, and regain all uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest. You gain one additional use when you reach level 7 (4 uses), level 10 (5 uses) and level 18 (6 uses) in this class.

## Level 7: Reflexive Toss
When you are targeted by an attack, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Kinetic Charge feature and attempt throw off the attack with a quickly charged explosion. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check with a DC equal to the attacker’s attack roll. On a success, the attack automatically misses you. If you successfully throw off a melee attack, both you and the attacker are also pushed back 10 feet in opposite directions by the explosion.

## Level 10: Supercharge
When you charge a weapon or piece of ammunition with your Kinetic Charge feature, you can expend two uses at once, empowering the feature’s effects, and providing a third option:  
***Kinetic Explosion.*** The explosion now has a radius of 10 feet, and the damage increases to 2d6 + your Fighter level on a failed save, or half as much on a success.  
***Pushing Blast.*** On a failed save, a creature is now pushed 10 feet away from the weapon or projectile and has the Prone condition. On a successful save, it is only pushed 5 feet, and is not Prone.  
***Concussive Burst.*** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn it must choose between its action, Bonus Action or Move - it can only take one.

## Level 15: Energy Font
You are no longer limited in the number of times per turn you can charge an object with your Kinetic Charge.  
Also, if you have no remaining uses of Kinetic Charge, you can now use your Bonus Action to regain one use.

## Level 18: Kinetic Detonation
As a Magic action, you can touch one Tiny non-magical object you are carrying, such as a piece of ammunition, a playing card or a dart, and flood it with kinetic energy, making it extremely volatile. The object erupts in a violent explosion after 1 hour, or when you stop Concentrating on it, as if Concentrating on a spell. When it explodes, each creature within 30 feet of the object must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Kinetic DC or take 8d8 Force damage and has the Prone condition. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not Prone.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest, or until you expend 3 uses of your Kinetic Charge to use it again.
