# Banneret
*Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun v5.5*

*Rally Fellow Heroes with Inspiring Leadership*  
Bannerets are paragons of valor and leadership who protect the innocent and rally fellow adventurers to the causes of justice and freedom. Many are knights serving in Cormyr, the Silver Marches, Damara, Chessenta, or other lands across Faerûn. They wander the realms as knights errant, taking the fight against evil beyond their kingdom's borders.  
A Banneret relies on judgment, bravery, and fidelity to the code of chivalry to guide them in defeating evildoers. A lone Banneret is a skilled warrior, but when leading a band of allies one of these warriors can transform even a poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.

## Level 3: Knightly Envoy
You know how to conduct yourself with grace as a noble ambassador. You gain the following benefits.  
***Comprehension.*** You can cast the Comprehend Languages spell but only as a Ritual. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.  
***Polyglot.*** You learn one language from the language tables in the Player's Handbook or chapter 2 of this book. When you finish a Long Rest, you can replace a language learned from this benefit with another language you have heard, seen signed, or read in the past 24 hours.  
***Well Spoken.*** You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, or Performance.

## Level 3: Group Recovery
When you use your Second Wind to regain Hit Points, you can choose a number of allies within a 30-foot Emanation originating from yourself, up to a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of those allies regains Hit Points equal to 1d4 plus your Fighter level. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 7: Team Tactics
When you use Group Recovery, each chosen ally has Advantage on D20 Tests until the start of your next turn.

## Level 10: Rallying Surge
When you use your Action Surge, you can choose allies within a 30-foot Emanation originating from yourself, up to a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Each of those allies can immediately take a Reaction to use one of the following options.  
***Attack.*** The ally makes one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.  
***Move.*** The ally moves up to half its Speed without provoking an Opportunity Attack.

## Level 15: Shared Resilience
When an ally you can see within 60 feet of yourself fails a saving throw, you can take a Reaction to expend a use of your Indomitable feature. The ally can immediately reroll the saving throw with a bonus equal to your Fighter level; the ally must use the new roll.

## Level 18: Inspiring Commander
You gain the following benefits.  
***Bolstered Rally.*** The area of effect for both Group Recovery and Rallying Surge is now a 60-foot Emanation.

A banneret is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of one in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.  
A banneret prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a banneret spearheads an attack, their actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.

## Level 3: Royal Envoy
Knights of high standing are expected to conduct themselves with grace in anyone’s presence. You learn two languages of your choice and you have proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you already have this proficiency you have Expertise in it instead and you can choose one other skill to have proficiency in.

## Level 3: War Banner
Your waving banner provides your allies an inspiring sight in battle. You have 3 Banner Dice, which are d10s. A Banner Die is expended when you use it. You regain 1 Banner Die when you finish a Short Rest and all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional Banner Die at level 10 and another at level 15. You can use your Banner Dice in the following ways:  
***Invigorate.*** As a Bonus Action you can choose up to three creatures of your choice that can see or hear you within 60 of you. Each creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to a roll of your Banner Die. The number of Hit Points regained increases by 1 extra roll of your Banner Dice at level 10 (2 rolls) and at level 15 (3 rolls).  
***Instruct.*** When a creature that can hear or see you within 60 feet of you misses an attack, you can use your Reaction to let it roll a Banner Die and add it to the result, potentially causing the attack to hit instead. If the attack still misses, the Banner Die isn’t expended.

## Level 7: Lead By Example
Your actions in combat serve as an example to your allies.  
***Pinpoint.*** When you use your Instruct feature and the attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to half of your Fighter level.  
***Assemble.*** When you use your Tactical Shift, you can choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It can immediately move up to half its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

## Level 10: Commander
You make your allies shine by utilizing your combat prowess and experience.  
***Apprise.*** When a spell or effect forces up to 3 of your allies to make a saving throw, you can expend a Banner Die to let each creature roll a d10 and add it to its save.  
***Single Out.*** Whenever you attack a creature, you can expend a Banner Die and choose one ally that can hear or see you within 60 feet of you. It can use its Reaction to make one attack against your target.

## Level 15: Flanking Position
When you attack a creature and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack, all creatures that can hear or see you within 60 feet of you have Advantage on their first attack against it before the start of your next turn.

## Level 18: Warlord
Your commanding presence reaches its peak.  
***Rally.*** When you use your Assemble feature, you can choose up to three creatures that can move with you.  
***Expose.*** When you use your Single Out feature, you can expend a second Banner Die to turn the attack of your ally into a Critical Hit.
