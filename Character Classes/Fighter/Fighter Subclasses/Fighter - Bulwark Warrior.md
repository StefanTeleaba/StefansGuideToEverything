*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Provoke Your Enemies, Protect Your Allies*  
Those who learn the fighting prowess of the Bulwark Warrior Warriors protect their allies from certain death. With endurance and strength as their primary skills, these warriors are prepared to take lethal strikes for their companions.

## Level 3: Protective Taunt
Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee attack using a weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can taunt it. Until the start of your next turn or until you have the Incapacitated condition, the target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you. A creature can only be affected by one Taunt at a time.

## Level 3: Weather and Storm
You have grown accustomed to being battered and bruised. As a Bonus Action, you toughen up for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Fighter level plus your Constitution modifier.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 7: Threatening Presence
You can provoke your enemies into single-minded hatred of you. As a Magic action, each creature of your choice that can hear you in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 Psychic damage and has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you. When you use this feature, you restore your use of Weather the Storm.  
You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
When you reach Fighter level 15, you gain another use of this feature.

## Level 10: Agressive Defense
You know when to switch from defense to offense. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can lose Temporary Hit Points equal to no more than half your Fighter level (round down) to deal extra damage to the target equal to the number of Temporary Hit Points lost in this way.

## Level 15: Improved Second Wind
Your endurance is unrivaled. When you regain Hit Points from Second Wind, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the roll's total.

## Level 18: Halt the Assault
When another creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to change the target to yourself. You have Resistance to all damage against that attack.
