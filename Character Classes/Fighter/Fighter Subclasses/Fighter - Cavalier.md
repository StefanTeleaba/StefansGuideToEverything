The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.

## Level 3: Cavalry Training
You are trained in mounted combat and the responsibilities that come with it.  
***Custodian.*** You have proficiency in the Animal Handling skill and one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.  
***Rider.*** You have Advantage on saves made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you donâ€™t have the Incapacitated condition.  
***Saddle Up.*** Mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

## Level 3: Unwavering Mark
You can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others.  
***Taunt.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, if you die, or if someone else marks the creature. While it is within the reach of your weapon, a creature marked by you has Disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.  
***Punish.*** If a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee attack against the marked creature as a Bonus Action on your next turn. You have Advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits it deals extra damage equal to half your fighter level. You can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain 1 use whenever you finish a Short Rest and all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 7: Warding Maneuver
You learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within the reach of your weapon is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a Reaction and add the number rolled to the target's Armor Class until the start of their next turn. If the triggering attack still hits, the target has Resistance against the attack's damage.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain 1 expended use when you finish a Short Rest and all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Hold the Line
You become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an Opportunity Attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, the target's Speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

## Level 15: Ferocious Charger
You can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must  make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier). On a failed save, it has Prone condition. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

## Level 18: Vigilant Defender
You respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special Reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your own. You can use this special Reaction only to make an Opportunity Attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal Reaction.
