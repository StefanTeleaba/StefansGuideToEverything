# Cavalier
*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - Subclasses Update*  
*This subclass was published on October 30th, 2025.*  

*Defend Your Allies on Foot or from a Mount*  
Cavaliers excel at mounted combat and guard those in their charge, often protecting their superiors and the weak. A Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartees at a state dinner.

## Level 3: Bonus Proficiency
You gain proficiency in one the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion. Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.

## Level 3: Born to the Saddle
You have Advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition.  
In addition, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement rather than half your Speed.

## Level 3: Unwavering Mark
You can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a Melee weapon, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, you die, or someone else marks the creature.  
While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.  
In addition, if a creature marked by you hits a creature other than you with an attack roll, you have Advantage on attack rolls against the marked creature until the end of your next turn.

## Level 7: Warding Maneuver
You learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can roll 1d8 as a Reaction if you’re wielding a Melee weapon or a Shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target’s AC against the triggering attack. If the attack still hits, the target has Resistance against the attack’s damage.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Hold the Line
Creatures provoke an Opportunity Attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, the target’s Speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn.

## Level 15: Ferocious Charger
During the first round of each combat, you and your mount’s Speed increases by 10 feet, and your movement doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for that round. When you move within 5 feet of a creature this round, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. A creature makes this save only once during a turn.

## Level 18: Vigilant Defender
In combat, you get a special Reaction that you can take once on every creature’s turn except your turn. You can take this Reaction only to make an Opportunity Attack, and you can’t take it on the same turn that you take your normal Reaction.

The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.

This effect ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, if you die, or if someone else marks the creature. While it is within the reach of your weapon, a creature marked by you has Disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.  
***Punish.*** If a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee attack against the marked creature as a Bonus Action on your next turn. You have Advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits it deals extra damage equal to half your fighter level. You can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain 1 use whenever you finish a Short Rest and all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 7: Warding Maneuver
You learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within the reach of your weapon is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a Reaction and add the number rolled to the target's Armor Class until the start of their next turn.

You become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an Opportunity Attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, the target's Speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.

## Level 15: Ferocious Charger
You can run down your foes, whether you're mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must  make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier). On a failed save, it has Prone condition. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

## Level 18: Vigilant Defender
You respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special Reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your own. You can use this special Reaction only to make an Opportunity Attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal Reaction.
