*Modified by Stefan*

As an archetypal Monster Hunter, you are an expert at defeating supernatural threats. Typically mentored by an older, experienced Monster Hunter, you learn to overcome a variety of unnatural defenses and attacks, including those of undead, lycanthropes, and other creatures of horror.

## Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Nature, or Perception.

## Level 3: Combat Superiority
You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice.  
***Maneuvers.*** You know all of the maneuvers from the "Maneuver Options" section later in this subclass's description. You can use only one maneuver per attack.  
***Superiority Dice.*** You have four Superiority Dice, which are d8s. A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Fighter levels 7 (five dice total) and 15 (six dice total).

## Level 3: Hunter's Mysticism
You always have the Detect Magic and Protection from Evil and Good spells prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level or as a Ritual. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

## Level 7: Monster Slayer
At 7th level, whenever you expend superiority dice to add to a damage roll, you can expend up to two dice instead of just one, adding both to the roll. Both dice are expended as normal. If the target of your attack is an aberration, a fey, a fiend, or an undead, don't roll those dice for the damage; instead use the highest number possible for each die.

## Level 10: Improved Combat Superiority
Your Superiority Die becomes a d10.

## Level 15: Relentless
Once per turn, when you use a maneuver, you can roll 1d8 and use the number rolled instead of expending a Superiority Die.

## Level 18: Ultimate Combat Superiority
Your Superiority Die becomes a d12.


### Maneuver Options
The maneuvers are presented here in alphabetical order.

***Precision Attack.*** When you miss with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die, roll that die, and add it to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit.

***Sharpened Attack.*** When you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.

***Sharpened Senses.*** When you make a Wisdom (Insight or Perception) check, you can expend one Superiority Die and add that die to the ability check.

***Superior Willpower.*** When you make an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can expend one Superiority Die and add that die to the roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.
