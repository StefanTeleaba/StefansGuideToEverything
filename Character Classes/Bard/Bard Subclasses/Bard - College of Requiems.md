# College of Requiems
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Sing the Songs of the Dead*  
Performing macabre melodies filled with grief-stricken chords and mournful refrains, the College of Requiems stirs the very bones of the dead. Requiem Bards weave necromantic magic into their funerary songs to control and empower a host of Undead minions.

## Level 3: Chilling Melody
You learn two Necromancy cantrips of your choice. These count as Bard spells for you but don't count against the number of cantrips you know.

## Level 3: Pluck the Heartstrings
Your Bardic Inspiration can pluck at the tethers of life. Each creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.  
***Defense.*** When the creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die to be reduced to a number of Hit Points rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die instead.  
***Offense.*** Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled as extra Necrotic damage dealt by the attack.

## Level 6: Stir the Bones
You always have the Animate Dead spell prepared. It counts as a Bard spell for you.  
When you expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, choose Undead creatures under your control within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures each gain a Bardic Inspiration die. These extra Bardic Inspiration dice do not count against your limit.  
When an Undead creature under your control expends a Bardic Inspiration die on an attack roll, it can also add the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die to the attack's damage roll if that attack hits.

## Level 14: Dual Death
When you cast a Necromancy spell that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature within range.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration dice (no action required).
