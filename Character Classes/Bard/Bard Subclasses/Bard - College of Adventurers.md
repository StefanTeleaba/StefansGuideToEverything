# College of Adventurers
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Be a Master of Classes*  
Bards from the College of Adventurers learn from heroes of old and stories of legend. Bards are jacks of all trades, and, for the College of Adventurers, this statement rings even truer. They combine all the skills of their companions into one, allowing them to be versatile and supportive. While not having a direct goal, many adventurer-studying Bards live to tell tales of other heroes or seek to create their own. Stories of great deeds, of desperate cunning, of magical anomalies, or of godly might fuel these Bards.

## Level 3: Talented Adventurer
You learn an adventurer's talent of your choice from the "Adventurer's Talent Options" section later in this subclass's description. You learn an additional adventurer's talent of your choice when you reach Bard levels 6 and 14.

***Barbarian.*** You've learned to fight with primal ferocity.  
As a Bonus Action while you aren't wearing Heavy armor, you can enter a rampage for 1 minute. During this time, you have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage, and you can't maintain Concentration. Your rampage ends early if you use a Bonus Action or have the Incapacitated condition.  
Once you use this talent, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

***Cleric.*** You've gained the ability to channel divine energy directly from the gods, emboldening allies and sanctifying their attacks. As a Bonus Action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you. For 10 minutes, the target gains Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Bard level plus your Charisma modifier. While a creature has Temporary Hit Points granted by this talent, it can choose to lose all remaining Temporary Hit Points when it hits a creature with an attack made with a weapon or Unarmed Strike, dealing extra Radiant damage equal to the number of Temporary Hit Points lost.  
Once you use this talent, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

***Druid.*** You can cast the Polymorph spell without expending a spell slot. When you cast the Polymorph spell with this talent, you can target yourself only and the maximum Challenge Rating of the Beast you can transform into equals half your Druid level.  
Once you cast the spell using this talent, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

***Fighter.*** You gain proficiency with martial weapons and training with Shields. In addition, you gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice.

***Monk.*** While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers. You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes, and you can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike. In addition, after you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action or take the Attack action, you can make one attack with an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

***Paladin.*** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee attack using a weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can expend a spell slot to deal an extra 1d6 Radiant damage to the target, plus another 1d6 per level of the spell slot.  
The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is a Fiend or an Undead.  
Once you use this talent, you must finish a Short Rest or Long Rest before you can use it again.

***Ranger.*** You always have the Hunter's Mark spell prepared. You can cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot without expending a spell slot.  
Once you cast the spell using this talent, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

***Rogue.*** You've adopted the quick thinking of heroes who have outsmarted their foes. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

***Sorcerer.*** Choose one of the following Metamagic Options available to the Sorcerer class: Careful Spell, Distant Spell, Empowered Spell, Extended Spell, Seeking Spell, Subtle Spell, or Transmuted Spell.  
When you cast a Bard spell, you can apply that Metamagic Option as if you had paid its Sorcery Point cost.  
Once you use this talent, you can't use it again until you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest.

***Warlock.*** You learn one Eldritch Invocation of your choice. If an invocation has a level requirement, use your Bard level.  
When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation for which you qualify.

***Wizard.*** You prepare any two spells from the Wizard spell list that are of a level you can cast. These count as Bard spells for you but do not count against your number of Prepared Spells.  
When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Wizard spells you have prepared and replace it with another spell from the Wizard spell list of a level you can cast.

## Level 3: Party Planner
While a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you, it can use a Bonus Action to take the Help action.

## Level 6: Well-Rounded
You gain proficiency with one type of Artisan's Tools of your choice, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice, and you know one language of your choice.

## Level 14: Improvisational Talent
When you finish a Long Rest, you can choose one adventurer's talent you know and replace it with one you don't.
