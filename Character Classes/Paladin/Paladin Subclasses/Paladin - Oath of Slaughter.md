# Oath of Slaughter
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Revel in Unbridled Violence*  
The only truth of war is death. The only virtue is to kill. The only victory is to survive. Heroism, honor, and glory are illusions. This is the creed of Tormach, Arch Daemon of Wrath, but this philosophy rings true for all warriors who devote themselves, body and soul, to the thrill of combat and the delight of bloodshed. Such champions find themselves at the forefront of armies, using the most violent methods at their disposal to bring battles to a swift close... or drawing out the war to sate their own appetites.  
Paladins who take the Oath of Slaughter share the following tenets:
- Violence is the end, not the means.
- Break the body to break the spirit.
- Revel in bloodshed, whether friend or foe.

## Level 3: Frenzied Slaughter
You can harness the rush of battle to drive you to even greater acts of violence. As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to enter a battle frenzy. You gain the following benefits while this feature is active.  
***Reflexive Attack.*** When you miss with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can take a Reaction to make another attack with the same weapon.  
***Condition Resistance.*** You have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed, Frightened, and Stunned conditions.  
***Duration.*** Frenzied Slaughter lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition. If your Frenzied Slaughter is still active on your next turn, you can extend it for another round by doing one of the following:
- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- You are Bloodied at the end of your turn.

Each time Frenzied Slaughter is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain it for up to 1 minute.

## Level 7: Bloodthirst Aura
Your lust for blood infects those around you. When a Bloodied ally within your Aura of Protection makes an attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, it gains a bonus to damage. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier.  
Additionally, when a Bloodied creature within your Aura of Protection makes a saving throw against a Sangromancy spell, you can take a Reaction to impose Disadvantage on the save.

## Level 15: Follow Through
When a creature in your Aura of Protection becomes Bloodied, you can take a Reaction to move up to half your Speed and make an attack with a Melee weapon or Unarmed Strike. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks, and you have Advantage on the attack roll.

## Level 20: Blood Knight
Your bloodthirst imbues you with preternatural strength and resilience, allowing you to keep sowing slaughter. As a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).  
***Crimson Armor.*** When a creature within your Aura of Protection becomes Bloodied by an enemy, you gain 30 Temporary Hit Points.  
***Seeing Red.*** When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.  
***Wanton Slaughter.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can choose any number of creatures within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. Each chosen creature takes Force damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) plus your Proficiency Bonus.
