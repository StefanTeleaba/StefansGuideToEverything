# Oath of Revelry
*Valda's Spire of Secrets: Player Pack v5.5*

*Work Hard and Party Harder*

*Paladins who swear the Oath of Revelry make a solemn vow to party day and night until their hearts give out. The antithesis of stuffy, lawful crusaders, these emissaries of carousal travel the land, crashing parties and raising hell wherever they raise a glass. Authorities bristle at their arrival, but the youth cheer, for a Party Paladin is always accompanied by a good time.*  
*These paladins share the following tenets:*  
- *Abide by the doctrines of the Codicus Brodicus.*
- *Celebrate every occasion, inviting friend and foe alike.*
- *When necessary, fight for your right to party.*

## Level 3: Conjure Drink
As a Magic action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to conjure a number of mugs filled with frothy ale up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), which appear in spaces within 30 feet of yourself. A creature that drinks the ale as a Bonus Action gains Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier and has Advantage on saving throws for 1 minute. When you finish a Long Rest, the mugs and remaining ale vanish.

## Level 7: Aura of Fraternity
You and your allies deal an extra 1d4 damage on attacks using Melee weapons or Unarmed Strikes while in your Aura of Protection. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike.

## Level 15: Merrymaker
When you or an ally within 30 feet of yourself that can see or hear you makes a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to give that creature Advantage on the roll.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. If the creature still fails the D20 Test, this use of Merrymaker isn't expended.

## Level 20: Party Animal
As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with the many-hued magic of revelry, granting the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).  
***Extra Damage.*** The extra damage from your Aura of Fraternity increases to 1d8.  
***Heroic Inspiration.*** At the start of each of your turns, you can give Heroic Inspiration to one ally within the aura.  
***Immunities.*** You and your allies have Immunity to the Blinded, Deafened, Exhaustion, and Poisoned conditions while in the aura.
