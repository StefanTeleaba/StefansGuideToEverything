# Oath of Guile

*Beguile your foes with Fey tricks*  
A Paladin’s sacred oath is incredibly personal and spiritually significant to the paladin - it is a deeply important and defining aspect of who they are. Nobody said they needed to be particularly serious though. Paladins who swear the Oath of Guile are committed to solving problems through quick wit and trickery, drawing power from the same source as many fey
creatures. They are particularly adept enchanters, beguiling and tricking others to act on their behalf on the battlefield.  
Paladins who swear the Oath of Guile tend to be chaotic by nature, but do share some loose tenets:
- Don’t take life too seriously
- Prove that nobody is untrickable.
- If someone is helpful, always consider their angle.

## Level 3: Oath Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Guile Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Silvered Tongue
You can empower your lies with supernatural credibility. When you make a Charisma (Deception) check, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to grant yourself a + 5 bonus to that check, and all subsequent Charisma (Deception) checks you make for the next 10 minutes (no action required). You must do so before you roll for the check.

## Level 3: Enchanting Presence
You can use your Channel Divinity to dazzle all those around you. As a Magic action, you can force creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has the Charmed condition for 1 minute. While Charmed in this way, the creature cannot willingly move further away from you. An affected creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.

## Level 7: Aura of False Allegiance
You constantly emanate beguiling magic which can cause your enemies to turn on one another.  
If a creature is Charmed by you, it is more susceptible to your suggestions while within your Aura of Protection. As a Bonus Action, you can command a creature in your aura that you have afflicted with the Charmed condition to make an attack against a different creature that you can see. The creature uses its Reaction to make an against the specified creature. If the target is not in range, the creature expends its Reaction doing nothing. The creature is able to perform this Reaction even if it is Incapacitated by the effect causing the Charm.

## Level 15: Convincing Defense
When you are targeted by an attack, you can use your Reaction to cast Sanctuary without expending a spell slot, targeting yourself. You must do so before the attacker rolls the attack roll.  
Once you use this Reaction, you cannot do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 20: Embodiment of Guile
As a Magic action, you can begin to evoke a fey presence that beguiles those around you. For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:  
***Charm Immunity.*** You have Immunity to the Charmed condition.  
***Overwhelming Guile.*** Whenever you force a creature to make a saving throw against the Charmed condition, the creature has Disadvantage on the saving throw.  
***Supernatural Charm.*** Creatures that have Immunity to the Charmed condition can be Charmed by you. However, such creatures have Advantage on saving throws against your Charm effects.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).
