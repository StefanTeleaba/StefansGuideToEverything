*With Great Power...*  
Paladins that take the Oath of Heroism bind themselves specifically and emphatically to the protection of the innocent and those in need. They are known for their ideals of leadership and bravery, and have a reputation of being self-sacrificing to a fault when an innocent’s life is in the balance. Stories of heroic paladins line the annals of history, told by those whose lives they saved.  
These paladins share the following tenets:  
- Protect the innocent at all costs.
- Never stand idly by as atrocities occur.
- Set the example for your allies to follow.

## Level 3: Oath Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Heroism Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Protect the Innocent
When you see another creature take damage, you can take a Reaction to expend a use of your Channel Divinity and move up to half your Speed in its direction. This movement does not provoke Opportunity Attacks, and if you end it within 5 feet of the creature taking the damage, a glimmering shield of force protects the creature, absorbing all the inciting damage for them. If the damage is caused by an area of effect and this movement causes you to move into the area, you become a target of that effect.

## Level 7: Hands of Liberation
When you use your Lay on Hands, you can now target any creature within your Aura of Protection. When you do, you can also provide one or both of the following effects to the target by spending 5 Hit Points from the pool for each effect; these points don’t also restore Hit Points. The effects last until the start of your next turn.  
***Agility.*** The creature’s movement does not provoke Opportunity Attacks.  
***Freedom.*** The creature gains the benefits of the Freedom of Movement spell.

## Level 15: Bout of Heroism
You have a store of heroic potential you can draw upon in moments of great need. At the start of your turn, you can choose to gain the following benefits until the end of the turn (no action required). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Savior.*** Your Speed increases by 30 feet.  
***Steadfast.*** You can take an additional Bonus Action on your turn, which can only be used to cast a Paladin spell with a Bonus Action casting time, to use your Lay on Hands feature, or to take the Help action.

## Level 20: Legendary Hero
Your boundless heroism shines in your finest hour, and no peril can outmatch your will to protect others. As a Bonus Action, you can gain the benefits below for 10 minutes. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).  
***Diversion.*** When a hostile creature starts its turn inside your Aura of Protection, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have Disadvantage on attacks against your allies (not including yourself) until the start of its next turn.  
***Font of Health.*** You gain an additional pool of Hit Points for your Lay on Hands feature containing 50 Hit Points. Any remaining Hit Points from the pool vanish when this feature ends.  
***Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing and Slashing damage.
