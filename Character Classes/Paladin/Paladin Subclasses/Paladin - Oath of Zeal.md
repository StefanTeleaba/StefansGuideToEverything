# Oath of Zeal
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Eliminate Threats to Ideological Purity* 
The Oath of Zeal is taken by paladins consumed by hatred for a specific group or ideology. Zealots, as these Paladins are sometimes called, pursue an inquisition against their enemies at all costs. They abandon compassion and honor as impediments to the more important work of ridding the world of those they deem dangerous or heretical.  
These Paladins share the following tenets:
- Reveal heresy and destroy those who practice it.
- Show unwavering conviction and unflinching resolve.
- Perform any sacrifice necessary to stop wickedness.

## Level 3: Mark of the Heretic
As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to mark a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself as a heretic.  
For 1 minute, your weapon attacks and Unarmed Strikes against the chosen creature can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. In addition, whenever the target starts its turn, you can take a Reaction to make a melee attack against that creature if it's within reach.

## Level 3: Oath of Zeal Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Zeal Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 7: Aura of Clarity
You and your allies have Immunity to the Blinded condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Blinded ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there. Additionally, you can see Invisible creatures within your Aura of Protection.

## Level 15: Compel Confession
You can cast Zone of Truth without expending a spell slot. In addition, a creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes 1d6 Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns while in your Zone of Truth until it chooses to fail its saving throw instead.

## Level 20: Apocalyptic Revelation
As a Bonus Action, you can reveal the true nature of your enemies for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required). You gain the following benefits.  
***Blinding Glory.*** Enemies that start their turn within 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw against the Paladin's spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature has the Blinded condition until the start of its next turn.  
***See the Truth.*** You have Truesight with a range of 60 feet.  
***Smite the Heretic.*** As a Bonus Action, you can choose a creature within 60 feet of yourself and reveal its weaknesses. You and your allies have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature.
