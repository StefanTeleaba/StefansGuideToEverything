# Wretched Bloodline Sorcery
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Wield Your Curse Like a Weapon*  
With every promise whispered to a fairy, every contract signed with a devil, and every pact made with the dead, there's a chance someone doesn't keep their end of the bargain. The vengeance of immortal beings lasts much longer than one lifetime, and the lingering magic of these curses can affect the mortal's descendants.  
These inherited magical afflictions may manifest as a plague, deformity, or aversion to the sun. In such families, children may be born who learn to master the latent magic within their inherited curses, turning their banes into personal boons—these sorcerers are known collectively as the Wretched.

## Level 3: Bad Luck Charm
You have the ability to cast a sliver of your curse onto another temporarily. As a Bonus Action, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The chosen creature has Disadvantage on the next D20 Test it makes before the start of your next turn.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest unless you spend 1 Sorcery Point (no action required) to restore your use of it.

## Level 3: Blood Ties
Your senses easily attune to the supernatural forces that caused your inherited affliction. You always have the Detect Evil and Good spell prepared and can cast it without expending a spell slot.  
In addition, choose one of the following types of creatures as the being that cursed your ancestor: Fey, Fiend, or Undead. On each of your turns while you maintain Concentration on Detect Evil and Good, including the turn when you cast it, creatures of the chosen type have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you can't be possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such creatures.  
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 3: Wretched Curse
You suffer from a curse inherited from an ancestor who failed to uphold their end of a bargain with an otherworldly power. Choose one of the following curses that was passed down to you.  
***Hulking.*** Your ancestor was cursed with a hulking frame. You have Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to escape notice by moving quietly. In addition, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level. Finally, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.  
***Nocturnal.*** Your ancestor was cursed to shun the light of day. You have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight while you are in sunlight. In addition, you can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness—both magical and nonmagical—within 120 feet of yourself.  
***Plaguebearer.*** Your ancestor was cursed with physical symptoms of a plague. You have Disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to influence an Indifferent Humanoid within 5 feet of yourself. In addition, you are Immune to the Poisoned condition and have Resistance to Necrotic damage.

## Level 6: Share the Burden
You always have the Bestow Curse spell prepared. You can cast the spell by spending 3 Sorcery Points instead of a spell slot. When you cast the spell in this way, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and its range changes to 60 feet for that casting.

## Level 14: Terrifying Visage
As a Bonus Action, you can adopt the terrifying visage of the being that cursed your ancestor for 10 minutes. During this time, you can take a Magic action to cause creatures of your choice you can see you within 30 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn. In addition, while your Terrifying Visage feature is active, you gain the following benefit based on the creature type chosen with your Blood Ties feature.  
***Fey.*** As a Bonus Action, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.  
***Fiend.*** You have Resistance to Cold and Fire damage.  
***Undead.*** When you take damage of any type other than Radiant, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage by half your Sorcerer level.  
Once you use Terrifying Visage, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 18: Vengeful Summons
Your magic has become powerful enough that you can call and command a servant of those who cursed you. Choose one of the following creatures based on the choice you made with your Blood Ties feature: Lamia or Troll (Fey only), Barbed Devil, Incubus, or Succubus (Fiend only), Ghost or Wraith (Undead only).  
You can take a Magic action and spend 5 Sorcery Points to summon your chosen creature. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. It disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points, you use this feature to summon another creature, or after 10 minutes have passed.  
The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.
