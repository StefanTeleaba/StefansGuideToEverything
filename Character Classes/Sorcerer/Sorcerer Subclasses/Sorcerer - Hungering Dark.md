# Hungering Dark
*Cthulhu by Torchlight v5.5*

*“When you tell us to fear the dark, it isn't to protect us, but to keep us under control.” — Veldeth, Scion of Midnight*

*When Sorcerers first manifest their abilities, they sometimes describe the experience as a slumbering portion of their identity awakening, a sudden understanding of their true nature.*  
*Other Sorcerers aren't so fortunate. The magic within claws at their souls and pushes at their mind. It is like a hungry beast, always ravenous, never satisfied despite desperate efforts. These poor spellcasters are living gateways to a realm of darkness and gloom, a place said to serve as the source of all undead.*  
*Sorcerers of the Hungering Dark are conflicted victims of their own power. They wield mighty spells, but, by using their magic, they create a bridge that allows horrid creatures to step into this world, even if for only a moment.*

## Level 3: Shadowed Soul
The darkness within allows you to push away the light. You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet. In addition, you can see through any magical Darkness you create with your Innate Darkness feature, unless you have the Blinded or Incapacitated condition.

## Level 6: Friends to Darkness
When you cast any spell from your Innate Darkness feaure, you can choose a number creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature can see through any magical Darkness you create for 1 minute.

## Level 14: Pure Darkness
When you cast any spell from your Innate Darkness feature that creates an area of Darkness, Darkvision and Blindsight can't see within the area of the spell.

## Level 18: One with Darkness
The darkness within you roils with hunger and transforms you. You exist in a shadowy state between reality and darkness. On your turn, you have the Invisible condition and can't be perceived by Truesight or Blindsight. You can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see but only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
