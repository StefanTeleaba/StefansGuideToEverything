*Master the Material and the Ethereal Planes*  
Ethereal Sorcerers are beings split between two words: the corporeal world of the living and the Border Ethereal superimposed over it. The souls of these Sorcerers have been drawn across the two planes, perhaps by drawing lineage from some sort of ethereal being, or maybe resulting from some sort of arcane mishap. In any case, you are constantly flitting between these two worlds, perhaps not entirely willingly.

## Level 3: Ethereal Magic
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Ethereal Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Ethereal Shift
Starting when you choose this origin, your body begins to shift back and forth to the Ethereal Plane, and you can use your momentary absence defensively. When you take damage of any type other than Force, you can use your Reaction to gain Resistance to that instance of damage.  
You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and regain all uses after completing a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Blink Master
You have gained some control over which plane you occupy when you flit between the Material and Ethereal planes. When you cast the Blink spell you can choose to do so by expending 3 Sorcery Points instead of a spell slot. When you cast Blink in this way, you roll two d20s instead of one to determine whether or not you travel to the Ethereal Plane, and choose which one to use.

## Level 6: Ethereal Banishment
As a Bonus Action, you can attempt to briefly banish a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to the Ethereal Plane. The target must make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it disappears and is transported to the Ethereal Plane until the end of your next turn, at which time it returns to the space that it left, or the nearest unoccupied space. Being on the Ethereal plane confers the following effects:  
***Visibility.*** The target can see and hear the plane it originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, but it can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away.  
***Incorporeal.*** Creatures that aren’t there can’t percieve or interact with the target unless it has some special ability to do so, such as Truesight. The target cannot affect any creature that isn’t also there.  
***No Reactions.*** The target cannot take Reactions, nor can it take the Ready action.  
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest, or until you expend 3 Sorcery Points to restore your use of it (no action required).

## Level 14: Planar Displacement
When you activate your Innate Sorcery feature, your body shifts to and from the Ethereal Plane at high frequencies, giving you ghost-like properties while it is active:  
***Ghostly Travel.*** You can move through solid matter as if it were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and you take 1d10 Force damage.  
***Ethereal Sight.*** You can see creatures on the Ethereal Plane up to a range of 60 feet and can affect them with your spells.

## Level 18: Being of Two Planes
When you cast Etherealness, in addition to stepping into the Ethereal Plane yourself, you can target a number of willing creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one extra creature) to also be affected by the spell. Other affected creatures can use a Magic action to end the spell’s effect on themselves before the spell ends, but if you take an Action to dismiss the spell, it ends on all affected creatures.
