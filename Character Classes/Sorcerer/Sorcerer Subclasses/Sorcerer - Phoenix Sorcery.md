# Phoenix Sorcery
*Unearthed Arcana - Sorcerer*  
*This subclass was published on February 6th, 2017.*  
*Modified by Stefan*  

Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix’s power dwells within you.  
That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can’t bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.  
More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.  
Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Phoenix Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Phoenix Spells**

## Level 3: Ignite
Whenever you touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, you can cause the object to start burning (no action required).

## Level 3: Mantle of Flame
The phoenix fire blazes within you. When you activate your Innate Sorcery, wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration. You gain the following benefits.  
- You shed Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.
- Whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack roll, the attacker takes Fire damage equal to half your Sorcerer level.
- When you cast a spell that deals Fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

## Level 6: Phoenix Spark
The fiery energy within you grows restless and vengeful. In the face of defeat, it surges outward to preserve you in a fiery roar.  
If you drop to 0 Hit Points and don't die outright, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Sorcerer level and can end the Prone condition on yourself. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes Fire damage equal to your Sorcerer level.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 14: Nourishing Fire
Your fire spells soothe and restore you. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that deals Fire damage, you regain Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier plus the spell slot's level.

## Level 18: Form of the Phoenix
You finally master the spark of fire that dances within you. When you activate your Innate Sorcery, you gain the following benefits.
- You have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
- You have Resistance to all damage.
- If you use your Phoenix Spark feature, each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you instead takes Fire damage equal to three times your Sorcerer level.
