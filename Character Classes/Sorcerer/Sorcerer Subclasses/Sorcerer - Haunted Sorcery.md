# Haunted Sorcery
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Commune with the Dead*  
Unlike other Sorcerers, the circumstances of your birth were mundane and you have no arcane inheritance passed down from strange ancestors. Instead, you gained your sorcerous powers after you survived an experience that left you near death. Since that experience, you've had a preternatural sense for danger and a ghostly companion that either can't, or won't, leave you alone. Some Haunted, as Sorcerers who share your origin are called, develop cordial relationships with their phantom, while others find their spectral companion to be a relentless nuisance.

## Level 3: Haunted Spells
When you reach a sorcerer level specified in the Haunted Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Sixth Spells
When you roll Initiative, you can add your Charisma modifier to the roll.

## Level 3: Phantom Companion
You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a Magic action without expending a spell slot.  
The familiar takes the form of a Specter, though it is an Undead instead of a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend. As a Magic action, you can command your phantom companion to gain the Invisible condition until it attacks or you cast a spell through it. While Invisible, it leaves no physical evidence of its passage and can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment or objects it is holding remains visible.  
Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make its Life Drain attack with its Reaction.

## Level 6: Strength of Spirit
Your bond with your phantom companion empowers it. You gain the following benefits:
- Your familiar's Hit Point maximum increases by four times your Sorcerer level.
- You can cast spells as if you were in the familiar's space.
- When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a Bonus Action to command your phantom companion to use its Life Drain attack with its Reaction.

## Level 6: Deathly Pallor
You have Resistance to Necrotic damage, and when you cast a Sorcerer spell that deals damage, it can deal your choice of Necrotic damage or its normal damage type.

## Level 14: Phantom Possession
As a Magic action, you can direct your phantom companion to possess a creature of your choice within 5 feet of your phantom. The target makes a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, your phantom companion enters the target's body for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target resists the efforts to possess it, and your familiar can't possess it again for 24 hours.  
Once the phantom companion possesses a creature's body, it controls that creature. The familiar's Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the creature's. The phantom companion otherwise keeps its game statistics.  
While the target is possessed, you have a telepathic link with your phantom companion as long as the two of you are within 100 feet. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to your phantom companion (no action required) unless you have the Incapacitated condition. Your phantom companion does its best to obey on its turn. If it completes an order and doesn't receive further direction from you, the phantom companion acts and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting itself.  
You can command the target to take a Reaction but must take your own Reaction to do so.  
Whenever the target takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the possession on itself on a success, and your phantom companion reappears in the closest unoccupied space.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 18: Become Death
You can transmute your physical form into a spectral one when near death. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead and gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Hit Point maximum. At the start of each of your turns, you lose 10 Temporary Hit Points and creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you take 10 Necrotic damage. While you have Temporary Hit Points granted by this feature, you have Resistance to all damage, a Fly Speed of 30 feet, can Hover, and you can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied space you were in.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
