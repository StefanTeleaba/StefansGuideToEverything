# Sonic Sorcery

*Control Vibrations and Manipulate Sound*  
Your innate magic stems from the power of sound and vibrations. You or someone from your lineage may have drawn this power from the chaotic noise of Limbo, or perhaps your ancestor was the chosen of a god of Thunder.  
Whatever the case, you are gifted with powers to create great thunderous booms, and to manipulate vibrations to confuse the mind, break down objects and negate sound entirely.

## Level 3: Sonic Magic
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Sonic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Arcane Restoration
Your affinity for creating noise-based effects grants you the following benefits:  
***Sonic Spells.*** When you cast a Sorcerer spell that deals damage, you can change its damage type to Thunder.  
***Violent Resonance.*** When you cast a level 1+ spell that deals Thunder damage, you can tune the sound waves to resonate within one creature that took the damage. Until the start of your next turn, the target’s Speed is reduced by half and it has Disadvantage on ability checks, as violent vibrations rock its body.

## Level 6: Resonant Soul
You have become resilient of the vibrations that cause sound. You have Resistance to Thunder damage. In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you gain the following benefits:  
***Tremorsense.*** You gain Tremorsense with a range of 30 feet, which counts as a form of sight when casting your Sorcerer spells.  
***Sonic Boom.*** When a creature suffers the effects of your Violent Resonance, you can inflict Thunder damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) to the target and each creature of your choice within a 5-foot Emanation centered on it.

## Level 6: Vocal Precision
You can manipulate the sound waves of your voice such that it is inaudible except to one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you. Alternatively, you can make it such that all creatures within 300 feet can clearly hear it.

## Level 14: Sonic Interference
As a Bonus Action, you can amplify or mute the sounds of a creature of your choice within 60 feet of you for 1 minute. The effect ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, if you use it again, or if you end it as a Bonus Action. An unwilling creature can avoid this effect by succeeding on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, and it can repeat this save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Select one of the following effects:  
***Constructive Interference.*** Any sound the target makes is ten times louder. It automatically fails any Dexterity (Stealth) check to not be heard and its attacks deal an extra 1d8 Thunder damage.  
***Destructive Interference.*** Any sound the target makes is entirely negated. It automatically succeeds on any Dexterity (Stealth) check to not be heard, and it cannot speak, nor perform the verbal (V) components of spells.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minumum once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 18: Thunderous Ascension
Your Resonant Soul feature improves, granting you the following benefits while your Innate Sorcery is active:  
***Echosense.*** Your Tremorsense now extends through air, and its range increases to 60 feet.  
***Sound Immunity.*** You have Immunity to Thunder Damage and to the Deafened condition.  
***Sonic Explosion.*** The size of the Emanation of your Sonic Boom increases to 20 feet, and the damage increases by an amount equal to half your Sorcerer level (round up).
