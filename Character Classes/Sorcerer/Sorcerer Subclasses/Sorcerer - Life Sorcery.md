*Summon a Lifelong Companion*  
The power to create life is typically one reserved by the gods, and even then, only of certain stations. But occasionally, following unintended divine intervention or perhaps a cosmic accident, a mortal individual is instilled with life-creating magic. These sorcerers carry a spark of Life, and are able to harness this magic to heal wounds, restore life to the lifeless, and to create new life, whole cloth from nothingness. When such a sorcerer casts a summoning spell, they have great latitude to form their creation into strange and unique forms, limited only by their magical prowess and their creativity.

## Level 3: Life Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Life Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.  
In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace the Summon Beast or Summon Fey spells in the table with a different spell that is of a level you can prepare from the following list: Summon Aberration, Summon Celestial, Summon Dragon, Summmon Elemental, Summon Fiend, or Summon Shadowspawn.
### Life Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spells                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 3              | Aid, Cure Wounds, Goodberry, Summon Beast |
| 5              | Revivify, Summon Fey                      |
| 7              | Aura of Life, Grasping Vine               |
| 9              | Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds     |

## Level 3: Bolster Life
Life bursts forth from your soul, and you can magically share a portion of it with your allies and your creations. Whenever you cast a spell of level 1 or higher that targets one or more creatures, you can grant one of the targets a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d6 + your Sorcerer level.  
Alternatively, whenever you summon a creature with one of your Life Spells, you can grant these Temporary Hit Points to the summoned creature.  
You can use this feature number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Custom Creations
Whenever you cast one of your Life Spells that summons one creature, you can augment its physical form in one of the following ways:  
***Arcane Strikes.*** When it deals Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing damage, it can choose to change the damage type to Force.  
***Fortification.*** The creature gains a bonus to its AC equal to half your Proficiency Bonus (rounded down).  
***Size Change.*** The creature’s Size increases or decreases by one category.  
***Water Adaptations.*** The creature gains a Swim Speed equal to its Speed, and can breathe underwater.  
***Wings.*** The creature gains a Fly Speed equal to its Speed, growing wings to accomplish flight.

## Level 14: Improved Custom Creations
Whenever you use your Custom Creations feature to augment a creature you summon, you can now make multiple augmentations on the same casting, costing one Sorcery Point per augmentation beyond the first. You cannot select any augmentation more than once.

## Level 18: Life Giver
When a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see takes damage that would reduce it to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Reaction to spare that creature with the magic that flows through your body. The creature suffers no effects of being reduced to 0 Hit Points, and immediately regains Hit Points up to half its Hit Point Total.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest, unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points to restore its use (no action required).
