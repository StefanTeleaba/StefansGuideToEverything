# Shadow Sorcery
*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - Horror Subclasses*  
*This subclass was published on May 6th, 2025.*  

*Bend Darkness and Doom to Your Will*  
Your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to the Shadowfell’s sinister energy and were transformed by it. Your shadowy magic allows you to command darkness, undeath, and woe with ease.

## Level 3: Eyes of the Dark
You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet and Blindsight with a range of 10 feet.  
In addition, if a spell you cast creates an area of Darkness, you can see normally through that spell’s Darkness.

## Level 3: Shadow Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Shadow Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Shadow Spells**
| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|:--------------:|--------|
| 3              | Bane, Darkness, Inflict Wounds, Pass Without Trace |
| 5              | Hunger of Hadar, Summon Undead |
| 7              | Greater Invisibility, Phantasmal Killer |
| 9              | Contagion, Creation |

## Level 6: Spirits of Ill Omen
You can cast Summon Undead without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a Long Rest.  
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and the spell ends early if you cast it again.

## Level 14: Shadow Walk
While you are in Dim Light or Darkness, you can take a Bonus Action to teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in Dim Light or Darkness.

## Level 18: Umbral Form
As a Bonus Action, you adopt a shadowy form, gaining the benefits below for 1 minute, until you have the Incapacitated condition, or until you end the form (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 6 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.  
***Incorporeal Movement.*** You can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you take 1d10 Force damage.  
***Shadow Resilience.*** You have Resistance to all damage except Force and Radiant damage.  
***Strength of the Grave.*** If you would drop to 0 Hit Points and not die outright, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 plus half the damage taken). If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to three times your Sorcerer level.

You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it.  
The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Shadow Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

## Level 3: Shadow Magic
Your connection to the Shadowfell ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Shadow Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Shadow Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spells                                                   |
|:--------------:|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 3              | Darkness, False Life, Inflict Wounds, Pass without Trace |
| 5              | Fear, Summon Shadowspawn                                 |
| 7              | Blight, Phantasmal Killer                                |
| 9              | Contagion, Seeming                                       |

## Level 3: Eyes of the Dark
You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet. If you already have Darkvision of this range or greater, it increases by 30 feet.  
In addition, when you cast the Darkness spell, you can choose to do so by expending 2 Sorcery Points instead of a spell slot. When you do so, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.

## Level 3: Strength of the Grave
Your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC equals 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can’t use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by Radiant damage or by a Critical Hit.  
After the saving throw succeeds, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Hound of Ill Omen
You gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes.  
***Summoning the Hound.*** As a Bonus Action, you can spend 3 Sorcery Points to magically summon a Hound of Ill Omen of shadow to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The Hound appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. See the Hound of Ill Omen Stat Block for its statistics.  
***Combat.*** In combat, the Hound shares your Initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours.  
***Duration.*** The Hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points, if you summon another one or after 1 minute. If the target is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Bonus Action on your next turn to designate a new creature you can see within 120 feet to be the target, otherwise, the Hound disappears at the end of the turn.

## Level 14: Shadow Walk
You gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, you can use your Bonus Action to magically Teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You can expend 2 Sorcery Points to remove the restriction that you must start and end the teleport in Dim Light or Darkness.

## Level 18: Umbral Form
When you activate your Innate Sorcery feature you can magically transform yourself into a shadowy form. While active, you have Resistance to all damage except Force and Radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside a creature or an object, you take 1d10 Force damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest, unless you expend 5 Sorcery Points to use it again.
