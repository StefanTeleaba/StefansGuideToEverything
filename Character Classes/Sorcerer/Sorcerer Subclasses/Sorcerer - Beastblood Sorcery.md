*v1.0*  

*Unleash the Primal Savagery of the Beastlands*  
Primal magic from the Beastlands has suffused you, granting you physical characteristics similar to the mighty beasts that populate the plane. Beastblood Sorcerers are known for mixing their spellcasting with savage attacks made with natural weapons that grow out of their bodies. Most Beastblood Sorcerers trace a direct lineage from the Beastlands, and are typically some kind of beastfolk, such as Aarakocra or Tabaxi, but members of other races have been known to take on this origin after some sort of magical encounter.

## Level 3: Primal Spells
Your connection to the Beastlands ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Bestial Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
### Bestial Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spells                                         |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 3              | Animal Friendship, Enhance Ability, Mage Armor |
| 5              | Elemental Weapon                               |
| 7              | Polymorph                                      |
| 9              | Commune with Nature                            |

## Level 3: Bestial Hide
You are able to call on the resilient hide of your bestial ancestry. When you cast Mage Armor targeting only yourself, you can choose to do so by expending two Sorcery Points instead of a spell slot. When you do so, you additionally gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier.

## Level 3: Primal Ferocity
Your lineage to the Beastlands allows you to transform your body to become more bestial.  
***Primal Form.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, select one of the Primal Form options listed at the end of this subclass. You gain the listed benefits until you next finish a Long Rest.  
***Natural Weapon.*** The primal form grants you a special way to make Unarmed Strikes. You can use your Charisma modifier in place of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes. You grow your natural weapon in a location on your body appropriate to its function: for example, claws would be grown on your hands, a horn would be grown on your head.  
***Appearance.*** Your appearance is augmented by your transformation, embodying the traits of beasts you are drawing power from. For example, you might grow thick fur on your skin and fangs if you choose the Hunter form, or webbed fingers and gills for the Diver form. Your aesthetic choices do not affect your game statistics.

## Level 6: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Moreover, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.  
In addition, when you hit with an attack made with your Primal Form’s natural weapon, you can change its damage type to Force, instead of its normal damage type.

## Level 14: Pack Magic
You have become attuned to the magical bond shared between bestial packs and can use its essence to enhance your spells. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that targets an ally, that ally gains Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Sorcerer level (rounded down) plus your Charisma modifier. If the spell targets multiple allies, you choose one ally to gain the Temporary Hit Points. While the creature has these Temporary Hit Points, it has Advantage on attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you.  
In addition, you can now change your choice of Primal Form whenever you finish a Short Rest.

## Level 18: Chimeric Transformation
Your body is so suffused with the primal magic of the Beastlands that you gain the ability to mix your primal forms together into a hybrid. Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, choose two Primal Forms to embody, instead of one. You gain the benefits and the Natural Weapons of both options, and any special benefits that apply only to one of the Natural Weapons now apply to both.
