## Level 1: Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class's description.  
***Cantrips.*** You know four Arcanist cantrips of your choice. Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Arcanist cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Arcanist levels 4 and 10, you learn another Arcanist cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Arcanist Features table.  
***Spell Points.*** The Arcanist Features table shows how many spell points you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended points when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells from the Cleric, Druid or Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Arcanist spells for you. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Arcanist levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcanist Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric, Druid or Wizard spell lists until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcanist Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level you can cast. For example, if you're a level 3 Arcanist, your list of prepared spells can include six Cleric, Druid or Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.  
If another Arcanist feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Arcanist spells for you.  
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a Long rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Arcanist spell of a level you can cast.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Arcanist spells.  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Arcanist spells.

## Level 2: Spellcrafting
Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs. You use the following options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Spell Points that it costs.  

***Distant Spell***  
*Cost: 1 Spell Point*  
When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Spell Point to double the spell's range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Spell Point to make the spell's range 30 feet.  

***Empowered Spell***  
*Cost: Varies*  
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend a number of Spell Points up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) to roll an additional number of damage dice equal to the number of Spell Points you spent.  

***Expanded Spell***  
*Cost: 1 Spell Point*  
When you cast a spell that has an area of effect, you can spend 1 Spell Point to double the value of the area specified in the spell's description.

***Extended Spell***  
*Cost: 1 Spell Point*  
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Spell Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours. If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

***Quickened Spell***  
*Cost: 1 Spell Point*  
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 1 Spell Point to cast an additional spell as part of the same action. The additional spell must have a casting time of an action and costs double the usual number of Spell Points.

***Transmuted Spell***  
*Cost: 1 Spell Point*
