# Trapper Guild
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Dispatch Monsters with Cunning Traps*  
Legends say that the founding members of the Trapper Guild were game hunters who had grown bored of stalking common elk and dreamed of taking down bigger game. Trappers take pride in their kills and the ingenuity exhibited when a trap works perfectly.  
The legacy of the Trapper Guild is a consistent testament to the benefits of lying in wait. The element of surprise is paramount to the trapper, whose kit can flourish before the hunter and monster even meet. Preparation is key, and the resourceful trapper has devices to assist in bringing down even the strongest foes.

## Level 3: Sneaky and Crafty
You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill and with Tinker's Tools.

## Level 3: Trapper Gadgets
You learn to create gadgets and mechanisms that help you during the hunt.  
As part of a Long Rest, you can craft two Trapper Gadgets if you have materials and Tinker's Tools on hand. Also, with 1 hour of work with such a kit and expending 20 GP worth of materials (such as equipment or monster salvage), you can create one Trapper Gadget from the list below.  
Some Trapper Gadgets allow your target to make an ability check or saving throw to resist the gadget's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
**Trapper Gadgets save DC** = 8 + Intelligence modifier + Proficiency Bonus

### Trapper Gadgets
***Dread Venom.*** A foul-smelling blade oil that causes wounds to hemorrhage and refuse healing. Dread Venom can coat one Slashing or Piercing weapon or up to 10 pieces of Slashing or Piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute and the oil lasts 8 hours once applied. When a creature takes damage from the poisoned item, it can't regain Hit Points until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

***Elemental Ammunition.*** The head of an arrow or bolt is tipped with poison, loaded with an acid vial, dipped in flammable oil, or coated with another substance. As a Bonus Action, you imbue with elemental power a single piece of ammunition that can be fired from a Longbow, Shortbow, or Crossbow as part of an Attack action. When a Elemental Am- munition is imbued, choose a damage type: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder. When a creature takes damage from the Elemental Ammunition, it takes an additional 2d6 damage of the chosen type.  
Elemental Ammunition discharges its energy if it hits, and it can't be recovered. If the attack misses, the Elemental Ammunition can be recovered and used again. Elemental Ammunition retains its power for 48 hours.

***Runic Bomb.*** Runic Bombs are used to hunt creatures resilient to mundane weapons. As a Bonus Action, you can throw the runic bomb at a point within 60 feet that you can see, creating a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. The Sphere spreads around corners, and its area is Lightly Obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind) disperses it. Whenever Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage is dealt to a creature inside the sphere, that damage is Force damage instead of its normal damage type.  
A Runic Bomb is destroyed after a single use.

***Scorpion Anchor.*** This weapon is intended to keep flying foes anchored to the ground or stop monsters from fleeing. The Scorpion Anchor can be fired from a Longbow, Shortbow, or Crossbow as part of an Attack action. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a Scorpion Anchor, it has the Restrained condition. A creature Restrained by the Scorpion Anchor can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Trapper Gadget save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.  
A Scorpion Anchor is destroyed after the Restrained creature escapes or dies.

***Terrain Cloak.*** Composed of local materials, a Terrain Cloak allows wearers to conceal themselves within the environment. Terrain Cloaks can be worn over Light or Medium armor and are donned and doffed with the speed of Light armor.  
Creatures have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to see you.  
The item lasts until you finish a Long Rest, at which point the item falls apart.

***Weretrap.*** A Weretrap detonates when its fragile exterior is broken. You can take a Utilize action to set the Weretrap in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A creature within 30 feet must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check against your Trapper Gadget DC to spot the trap. Creatures have Disadvantage on this check.  
A creature that steps into a space containing a Weretrap triggers the trap and makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d10 Bludgeoning damage and has the Prone condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.  
The Weretrap can also be used as a Light Ranged weapon with the Finesse and Thrown property. It has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. On a hit, the Weretrap deals 3d10 Bludgeoning damage and the target has the Prone condition.  
The Weretrap is destroyed after it is triggered or thrown, regardless of whether it hits or misses.

## Level 7: Ambusher's Advantage
You have become a ferocious ambusher. When you roll Initiative, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. Additionally, you can't be surprised by enemies that inlcude creature types in your Monster Grimoire.

## Level 10: Agile Response
You can leap aside to avoid enemies rushing toward you. When a creature makes a melee attack roll against you, you can take a Reaction to impose Disadvantage on that roll and use your Studied Response as part of the same Reaction. Whether the attack hits or misses, you can then move up to half your Speed. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks.

## Level 15: Monster-Hide Armor
You have learned to craft a set of Light or Medium armor by using dragon scales, werewolf hide, troll leather, or a similar monster component. The armor takes on the appearance of your choice, reflecting the component it is made from.  
The armor has the same properties as Light or Medium armor (your choice when the armor is crafted) and gains two modifications from the Armor Modifications list. Whenever you gain a Monster Hunter level, you can replace one of these modifications with another modification.  
Modifications require the armor to be worn to function.

## Level 18: Rapid Tinkerer
You have become capable of crafting trapper tools at a much faster rate. You can spend 1 minute to make a Trapper Gadget without spending GP or components.  
You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
