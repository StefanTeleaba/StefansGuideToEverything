# Occultist Guild
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Hunt Mages and Magical Adversaries*  
In Etharis, there are those who fear magic, and those who seek to understand it. Monster Hunters from the Occultist Guild know folk from both sides are equally dangerous. An Occultist investigates the arcane, the supernatural, and the uncanny, while avoiding the influence of superstition or ideology. Despite their reputation as mage hunters, Occultists don't burn their enemies at the stakeâ€”Occultists put them to the sword, as that's what swords are for. Knowledge and magic give Occultists an edge over their mystical adversaries. Their spells are used to detect and defend against dangerous arcana, and, above all, magic is used to destroy monsters that can't be harmed by steel.

## Level 3: Acolyte of the Occult
You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.

## Level 3: Spellcasting
Your study of the occult gives you the ability to cast spells.  
***Cantrips.*** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Whenever you gain a Monster Hunter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another of your choice from the Wizard spell list.  
When you reach Monster Hunter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.  
***Spell Slots.*** The Occultist Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. Burning Hands, Detect Magic, and Protection from Evil and Good are recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Monster Hunter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Occultist Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Monster Hunter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.  
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Monster Hunter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an Arcane Focus as Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

## Level 3: Arcane Interference
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creature types in your Monster Grimoire. Additionally, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell or makes a spell attack, you can use Studied Response against that creature before the spell is cast.

## Level 7: Mage Hunter
You consider Humanoids that can cast spells as being a creature type in your Monster Grimoire.  
Additionally, when you damage a creature type in your Monster Grimoire that is Concentrating, it has Disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its Concentration.

## Level 10: Occult Knowledge
Your knowledge of magic has increased so that you learn to cast Rituals. You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and it's a spell you have prepared.  
In addition, you learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or any combination thereof (see a class's section for its spell list). A spell you choose must have the Ritual tag.  
When you reach Monster Hunter level 14, you can replace one of the spells you know from this feature with another spell of your choice from any spell list. The new spell must have the Ritual tag.

## Level 15: Magical Aegis
You gain the ability to extend a protective charm. You radiate an unseeable aura in a 20-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. You and allies in your aura have Advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creature types in your Monster Grimoire.  
Additionally, you always have the Counterspell spell prepared. You can cast Counterspell once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 18: Arcane Response
You have learned to anticipate your enemies well enough to rapidly cast spells in response to their attacks. When you use Studied Response, you can cast a spell. The spell must have a casting time of an action and must target only that creature.
