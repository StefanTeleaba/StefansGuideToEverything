# Devourer Guild
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide*

*Gain Power by Consuming Monster Flesh*  
Folk in Etharis don't always speak highly of Monster Hunters, and many consider them to be just as depraved and inhuman as the evils they vanquish. Many of the appalling tales about Monster Hunters can be attributed, directly or indirectly, to the Devourer Guild, who are accused of being monstrous cannibals.  
The truth is barely any better. Devourers have spent their days consuming the flesh and blood of the monsters they slay, and, over time, their metabolism has changed to tolerate this disgusting practice. Devourers adopt mutations shortly after consuming their prey.

## Level 3: Alchemical Gastronomy
You gain proficiency with Alchemist's Supplies and Cook's Utensils.

## Level 3: Transmuting Metabolism
You gain the ability to consume monster remains, which causes your body to adopt powerful and frightening mutations. These appear in the "Mutations" section later in the subclass's description.  
***Salvaging Portions.*** As a Utilize action, you can harvest a single portion from the physical remains of a creature. Only one portion can be harvested from each creature. Record the monster's creature type. A harvested portion lasts until you finish a Long Rest, at which point it loses its potency.  
***Consuming Portions.*** As a Bonus Action, you can consume a portion. After you consume the portion, you choose a mutation to gain, depending on the creature's type. You can gain the benefits of consumed portions a number of times up to 1 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). When you finish a Long Rest, you regain the ability to safely consume portions.  
You can benefit from multiple portions simultaneously, but you can't gain the same mutation more than once at the same time.

### Mutations
The mutations are presented here in alphabetical order, with required creature types shown in brackets after the mutation's name.  
***Acid Blood (Aberration, Ooze, Plant).*** For 1 minute, your blood becomes acidic. Each time a creature hits you with an attack while within 5 feet of you, it takes 2d6 Acid damage.  
***Acumen (Celestial, Fiend, Fey).*** For 1 hour, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks. Additionally, choose either Intimidation or Persuasion. You have Advantage on ability checks using the chosen skill.  
***Awareness (All).*** For 10 minutes, you know the location of creatures that are the same type as the creature you consumed within 60 feet of you that are not behind Total Cover.  
***Flight (Celestial, Dragon, Elemental).*** For 10 minutes, you grow feathery, feathery, or spectral wings from your back. You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. You can't benefit from this mutation while wearing Heavy Armor.  
***Infused (Dragon, Elemental, Ooze).*** Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder. For 10 minutes, whenever you hit with an attack, you can cause it to deal the chosen type rather than its normal damage type.  
***Invisibility (Fey, Fiend, Undead).*** For 10 minutes, you have the Invisible condition. This effect ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), or you attack or cast a spell.  
***Might (Beast, Construct, Giant).*** For 1 minute, you have Advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. You also have Advantage on attack rolls using Strength, and you deal 1d6 extra damage to targets you hit with a Strength-based attack. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.  
***Natural Weapons (Beast, Dragon, Monstrosity).*** For 1 hour, you gain natural weapons. You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike. This damage can be Piercing or Slashing. You choose each time you make an attack. You can also make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action. You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes.  
***Regeneration (Beast, Giant, Monstrosity).*** You regain Hit Points equal to 2d8 plus your Monster Hunter level.  
***Resistance (Construct, Elemental, Undead).*** For 1 minute, you have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.  
***Telepathy (Aberration, Fiend, Plant).*** For 1 hour, you can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Additionally, you have Resistance to Psychic damage.

## Level 7: Synchronized Response
Your ingestion of monsters heightens your understanding of them and their behaviour. You gain this additional effect when you consume a monster portion: For 1 minute, when you make an attack as part of a Reaction, you deal an extra 1d6 damage. This damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.

## Level 10: Gnawing Hunger
Your hunger for your enemy allows you to partake of its essence during battle. When you deal damage to a creature with a melee attack using a weapon or Unarmed Strike, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage dealt. If the target is a creature type in your Monster Grimoire, you instead gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt instead.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 15: Alchemical Decoctions
You can spend 1 hour and 20 GP worth of alchemical ingredients (such as special herbs or monster salvage) to use your Alchemist's Supplies to convert a monster portion into a decoction. A decoction is a magic potion that grants the benefits of a consumed monster portion. You can have 4 unconsumed decoctions active. You can destroy a decoction as a Utilize action.  
A creature other than you can consume 1 decoction without adverse effects. A creature gains 1 Exhaustion level for each decoction it consumes after the first. A creature must finish a Long Rest before it regains the ability to safely consume a decoction.

## Level 18: Acquired Taste
Your hunger for monster portions has increased to the point of being insatiable. You can now consume 1 additional portion safely. Additionally, for 1 minute when you consume a portion, you have Advantage, on attack rolls made as part of a Reaction.
