Feeling a deep connection to the environment around them, some rangers reach out through their magical connection to the world and bond with a swarm of nature spirits. The swarm becomes a potent force in battle, as well as helpful company for the ranger. Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their swarm.

## Level 3: Gathered Swarm
A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. While you’re alive, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its appearance.  
Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack:  
***Damage.*** The attack’s target takes 1d6 Piercing damage from the swarm.  
***Forced Movement.*** The attack’s target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.  
***Carrying Swarm.*** You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.

## Level 3: Swarmkeeper Magic
Your connection to your Swarm ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Ranger level specified in the Swarmkeeper Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

***Carrying Swarm.*** When you are moved by Gathered Swarm, it gives you Half Cover until the start of your next turn.

## Level 15: Swarming Dispersal
You can discorporate into your swarm, avoiding danger. When you take damage, you can use your Reaction to give yourself Resistance to that damage. You vanish into your swarm and then Teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you, where you reappear with the swarm.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once). You regain one use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
