*Run for Your Life*  
For one reason or another, you are actively being pursued by a powerful Hunter, whom you are not yet equipped to face. You have stayed alive up to now through your wit, your survival instincts, and by developing keen evasive techniques.

## Level 3: Hunted Spells
When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Hunted Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
### Hunted Spells

## Level 3: Flight of the Hunted
As a Bonus Action, you can take one of the following actions: Dash, Disengage, Dodge or Hide. When you do, you also gain one of the following benefits:  
***Sprint.*** You can move an additional 15 feet before the end of your current turn.  
***Evade.*** You have Advantage on the next Dexterity check or Dexterity saving throw (your choice) you make before the start of your next turn.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once). You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Fleeing Strike
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack, you can deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target, provided you have moved at least 10 feet away from the target since the start of your turn.

## Level 7: Escape Hunter
When a creature misses you with an attack, you can use your Reaction to move up to your Speed away from the attacker without provoking Opportunity Attacks. You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 11: Prey's Retaliation
When a creature deals damage to you, you are empowered to defend yourself against it. Until the end of your next turn, you can deal your Fleeing Strike damage to it on each attack you make against it, not just once per turn, and without the need to move away.

## Level 15: Master Evader
When you use Flight of the Hunted, you can now take two of the listed actions, and you gain Resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.
