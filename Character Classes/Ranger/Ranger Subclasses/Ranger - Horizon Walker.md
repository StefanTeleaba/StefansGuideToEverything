Horizon walkers guard the world against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to ravage the mortal realm with otherworldly magic. They seek out planar portals and keep watch over them, venturing to the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as needed to pursue their foes. These rangers are also friends to any forces in the multiverse – especially benevolent dragons, fey, and elementals – that work to preserve life and the order of the planes.

## Level 3: Horizon Walker Magic
Your travels through the multiverse ensure you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Ranger level specified in the Horizon Walker Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Horizon Walker Spells
| Ranger Level |             Spells            |
| :----------: | ----------------------------- |
|       3      | Protection from Evil and Good |
|       5      | Misty Step                    |
|       9      | Haste                         |
|       13     | Banishment                    |
|       17     | Teleportation Circle          |

## Level 3: Blitzing Strikes
You gain the ability to pass between the planes in a blink of an eye. Once on your turn when you use the Attack action, you can Teleport up to 10 feet before one attack to an unoccupied space you can see. That attack deals an additional 1d4 Force damage.

## Level 3: Detect Rift
You can sense disturbances in the veil between the planes. As an action, you detect the distance and direction to the closest planar portal or a portal that has been opened in the last 7 days within a 1 mile radius. Within that same radius, you can sense the distance and direction of a space a creature has Teleported to or from within the last 7 days. You can then expend a use of your Favored Enemy feature to cast Hunter’s Mark without expending a spell slot targeting the creature that Teleported, whether or not the creature would be within the range of the spell.  
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 7: Ethereal Step
You learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a Bonus Action on your turn, you can cast the Etherealness spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long rest.

## Level 11: Distant Strikes
Your ability to jump between planes becomes faster than ever, granting you the following benefits:  
***Greater Blitzing Strikes.*** You can use your Blitzing Strikes feature on each attack you make as part of the Attack action, instead of just once per turn.  
***Crowd Cutter.*** When you use the Attack action and attack two different creatures with the action, you can make one additional attack with it against a third creature.

## Level 15: Spectral Defense
Your ability to move between planes enables you to slip through the planar boundaries to lessen the harm done to you during battle. When you take damage from an attack, you can use your Reaction to give yourself Resistance to all of that attack's damage. Until the start of your next turn, you have Resistance to one damage type dealt by the triggering attack.
