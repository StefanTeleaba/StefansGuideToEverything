# Vermin Lord
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Grow Powerful from Strength in Numbers*  
Vermin Lords cultivate loyal hordes of disease-bearing rodents to help them battle greater evils. For many of these Rangers, that greater evil is some kind of societal ill, but a rare few see their fellow Humanoids as an infestation that threatens the natural world. Regardless of their goal, they make their homes in sewers, slums, and other forgotten places where they are free to plot against their enemies and tend to their verminkin.

## Level 3: Verminkin
You can comprehend and verbally communicate with Tiny Beasts.  
As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot to summon vermin swarms. You summon a number of swarms equal to the slot's level for 1 hour. Each swarm is summoned to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. A swarm uses the Swarm of Vermin stat block.  
In combat, each swarm acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can command each swarm with a single Bonus Action.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 3: Swarming Strikes
As a Bonus Action, you can command all of your swarms to make an Attack action instead of just one. Alternatively, a single swarm can attack twice instead of once when it takes the Attack action.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 3: Vermin Lord Spells
When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Vermin Lord Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 7: Filth and Fortitude
The time you've spent with plague-bearing rodents has rendered you Immune to the Poisoned conditions. Additionally, you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

## Level 11: Infectious Spread
When you use Swarming Strikes, each swarm that takes the Attack action makes one additional attack. Each creature damaged by a swarm's attack during this action has the Poisoned condition until the start of your next turn.

## Level 15: Strength of the Swarm
You can call on your rodent minions for defense. When you take damage from a creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself, you can take a Reaction to direct the damage toward a swarm you control you can see within 5 feet of yourself.
