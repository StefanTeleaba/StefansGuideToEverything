## Level 3: Primal Sight
You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.  

## Level 3: Primal Transformation
The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see "Known Forms" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Ranger level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.  
***Number of Uses.*** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
You gain one additional use when you reach Ranger levels 7, 11 and 15.  
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).  
***Animal Form.*** You know one Beast form for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1. Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can replace your known form with another eligible form.  
***Rules While Transformed.*** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:  
**Armor Class.** Until you leave the form, your AC equals 13 plus the beast's Dexterity modifier if that total is higher than the Beast's AC.  
**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to three times your Ranger level.  
**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.  
**No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.  
**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.

## Level 7: Improved Animal Form
While in a Wild Shape form, you gain the following benefits.  
***Bestial Fury.***  You gain the following Action.  
**Rend.** *Melee Attack Roll:* +Str/Dex, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 1d10 +Str/Dex Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing damage.  
When you take the Attack action while in Wild Shape, you can attack twice using the Beast form's attack.  
***Empowered Strikes.*** Each of your attacks in a Wild Shape form can deal its normal damage type or Force damage. You make this choice each time you hit with those attacks.  
***Fast Movement.*** Your speed increases by 10 feet while you are in your Wild Shape form.  
***Large Size.*** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you can cause your form to grow up to Large size.  
***Primal Beast.*** Your Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores increase by 4 while you are in your Wild Shape form.  

## Level 11: Greater Animal Form
***Fast Movement.*** Your speed increases by 20 feet while you are in your Wild Shape form.  
***Primal Beast.*** Your Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores now increase by 8 while you are in your Wild Shape form.  

## Level 15: Ultimate Animal Form
***Fast Movement.*** Your speed increases by 30 feet while you are in your Wild Shape form.  
***Huge Size.*** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you can cause your form to grow up to Huge size.  
***Primal Beast.*** Your Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores now increase by 12 while you are in your Wild Shape form. In addition, your Strength, Dexterity and Constitution scores increase by 2, to a maximum of 30.
