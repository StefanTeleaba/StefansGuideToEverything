# Aerial Explorer

*Take to the Air and Explore the Skies*  
A common fantasy of ground dwelling creatures is to take to the skies - an act of absolute freedom. You are one such dreamer, and have practiced in aeromancy, the magic of manipulating air and wind to achieve this goal. With the aid of a piece of specialised gliding equipment, the skies are now gleefully yours to explore.

## Level 3: Aeromancy Magic
Your practice in Aeromancy ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Ranger level specified in the Aeromancy Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
### Aeromancy Spells
| Ranger Level | Spells         |
|--------------|----------------|
| 3            | Longstrider    |
| 5            | Gust of Wind   |
| 9            | Wind Wall      |
| 13           | Dimension Door |
| 17           | Cloudkill      |

## Level 3: Glider
You have constructed, found or inherited a gliding apparatus which can keep you aloft with the aid of aeromancy. The glider has an appearance of your choice, though your choice doesn’t affect its game statistics.  
At any time while you are more than 10 feet off the ground and are falling, you can use your Reaction to begin Gliding until you reach the ground or you have the Incapacitated condition. If you stop gliding while in the air, you fall. Your glider can support little more than your own weight; you cannot Glide while you have the Grappled or Restrained conditions, while carrying more than your body weight or while you are wearing Heavy Armor. Gliding imparts the following properties on you:  
***Descent.*** You descend 5 feet at the start of each of your turns, and again each time you make an attack. You ignore this property if you have a Fly Speed.  
***Movement.*** On your turn you can Move in any direction up to your Speed, but cannot ascend. You ignore this property if you have a Fly Speed.  
***Volitant Strike.*** Once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can propel the strike with bursts of wind, causing it to deal an extra 1d6 damage. This damage increases to 2d6 when you reach level 11.

## Level 3: Updraft
As a Bonus Action, you can call on elemental wind to launch yourself up into the air. When you do so, you ascend 30 feet. You can halt this movement at any time.  
The distance you ascend increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 45 feet at level 7, and to 60 feet at level 11.  
You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once) and regain all uses after finishing a Long Rest. You can regain one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

## Level 7: Evasive Maneuver
You can deftly maneuver your glider out of the way of incoming hazards. When you are targeted by an attack or an area of effect while Gliding, you can use your Reaction to maneuver out of the way, moving 15 feet in a direction of your choice. One of the following effects occurs, depending on what you were targeted with:  
***Attack.*** The attack is made against you at Disadvantage. If this movement causes you to move out of range of the attack, it automatically misses.  
***Area of Effect.*** You have Advantage on any Dexterity saving throw you make to resist the effect. If this movement causes you to entirely move out of the area, you are instead unaffected by it.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Alternatively, you can expend a use of your Updraft feature to use it.

## Level 11: Soaring
Your skills in aeromancy have grown tremendously, improving your Glider feature in the following ways:  
***Movement.*** While Gliding, your Speed increases by 10 feet and you can now move freely in any direction, including upwards.  
***Maneuverability.*** While Gliding, you can Disengage as a Bonus Action.  
***Volitant Strike.*** When you use your Volitant Strike, you can additionally push the target 10 feet horizontally away from you, so long as they are no more than one size larger than you.

## Level 15: Aerial Dominance
If you roll for Initiative and are missing any uses of your Updraft feature, you regain one use.  
In addition, when you use your Updraft feature, you can launch yourself in any direction of your choice, not just upwards, and you have Advantage on the next attack you make before the end of your turn.
