You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A Monster Slayer seeks out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.

## Level 3: Monster Slayer Magic
Your training to hunt monsters ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Ranger level specified in the Monster Slayer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Monster Slayer Spells
| Ranger Level |             Spells            |
| :----------: | ----------------------------- |
|       3      | Protection from Evil and Good |
|       5      | See Invisibility              |
|       9      | Counterspell                  |
|       13     | Banishment                    |
|       17     | Hold Monster                  |

## Level 3: Slayer’s Prey 
You hunt most effectively when focussing your ire on a single target. Your Hunter’s Mark spell improves in the following ways:  
***Slayer’s Strike.*** Once per turn when you deal the extra damage of your Hunter’s Mark, the damage increases by 1d6.   
***Hunter’s Sense.*** When you mark a creature, you immediately learn whether it has any damage Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from Divination magic, you sense that it has no damage Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities.

## Level 7: Supernatural Defense
You gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Hunter’s Mark forces you to make a saving throw, you add 1d6 to your roll.

## Level 11: Slayer’s Prey Improvement
Your Hunter’s Mark spell improves in the following ways:  
***Slayer’s Strike Improvement.*** The extra damage of your Slayer’s Strike increases to 2d6.  
***Dual Concentration.*** Concentrating on Hunter’s Mark does not prevent you from Concentrating on other Ranger spells. While you are Concentrating on both Hunter’s Mark and another spell, whenever you need to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your Concentration, you only roll once, losing Concentration on both spells on a failure. Starting at level 13, when you gain the Relentless Hunter feature, losing Concentration on a different spell doesn’t cause you to stop Concentrating on Hunter’s Mark.

## Level 15: Slayer’s Counter
You gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Hunter’s Mark forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your Reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.
