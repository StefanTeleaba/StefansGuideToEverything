*Swing through the Jungle and Wrestle Mighty Beasts*  
Jungleborn Rangers typically don’t adopt their lifestyle by choice, rather by circumstance. These Rangers are raised in the jungle, often brought up and cared for by local animals, forcing them to adapt to the ways of the wild to survive. They attune themselves with the plants and animals of their home, taking on animalistic characteristics and learning to traverse the environment with ease.  
Jungleborn are known for their primal and uncivilized behaviors, and for their primal magic, which allows them to treat any terrain as their own personal jungle.

## Level 3: Bestial Speech
Raised by animals, you have learned magic to aid you in conversing and covorting with beasts. You always have the Speak with Animals and Animal Friendship spells prepared.  
You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Lean Muscle
Surviving in the jungle has forced you to hone your physical prowess, such that you can wrestle with powerful beasts and climb trees with ease. You gain proficiency with the Athletics skill. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with a different skill available to Rangers at level 1 of your choice.  
Furthermore, you can use your Dexterity score in place of your Strength score when you make Strength checks, and when determining the saving throw DC of your Unarmed Strikes when you take the Shove or Grapple options.

## Level 3: Jungle Fury
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can channel your primal aggression into one of the following effects:  
***Savage Strike.*** The target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type.  
***Primal Bellow.*** The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC have the Frightened condition until the end of its next turn.  
***Primal Physicality.*** The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against one of your Unarmed Strike options before the end of your next turn.

## Level 7: Vine Swing
As a Bonus Action, you can create a spectral vine which emerges from above you and reaches down into your hand. The vine is 20 feet long and leads from you to a point you can see within its reach, and you use it to swing through the air to an unoccupied space within its reach without provoking Opportunity Attacks. The vine then disappears.  
If you are Grappling a creature when you use this Bonus Action, the creature moves with you, but if you drag it along the ground, the Grapple ends.  
You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 11: Complex Swing
When you use your Vine Swing feature, you can swing through the air in a complex arc before landing, and can interact with creatures on your path. The vine now lasts until the end of your turn or until you move out of its reach, and while it exists you can continuously swing anywhere within its reach without using your Movement.  
If you take the Attack action while swinging in this way, you can make one additional attack, but cannot use it to make a weapon attack against a target you have already hit on this turn.

## Level 15: Jungle Champion
At the start of your turn, you can unleash your primal nature (no action required). You gain the following benefits until the start of your next turn.  
***Fearless.*** You have Immunity to the Frightened condition.  
***Unstoppable.*** Each time you take damage, you can reduce it by an amount equal to half your Ranger level (rounded down).  
***Jungle’s Assault.*** You can use your Jungle Fury feature on each of your attacks, not just once per turn.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore a use of it by expending a spell slot (no action required).
