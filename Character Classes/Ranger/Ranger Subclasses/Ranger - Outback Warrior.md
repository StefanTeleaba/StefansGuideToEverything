# Outback Warrior
[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)

You’re a true blue kinda bloke or sheila, a battler of the outback: a dry land of desert and brush which is filled with some of the most dangerous critters known to man. Where most would turn away from such a harsh inhospitable place, you’ve embraced it and called it your home, and doing so has hardened your resolve.

## Level 3: Outback Magic
When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Outback Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
### Outback Spells

| 3            | Animal Friendship      |
| 5            | Protection from Poison |
| 9            | Fear                   |

| 17           | Hold Monster           |

## Level 3: Outback Weapon User
You have become an expert at using the Whip, the Boomerang and the Knife (Dagger), which are your Outback Weapons. When you choose your Weapon Masteries, you can select one of these weapons for free.  
When you make an attack with one of your Outback Weapons, you can do so using either your Strength or Dexterity (your choice) for the attack and damage rolls, its damage die is 1d8 and it gains special abilities:  
**Boomerang.** After you make a ranged attack with a Boomerang, it always returns to your hand, regardless of whether the attack hits or misses.  
***Returning Strike.*** As the weapon is returning to your hand, you can use your Bonus Action to make one ranged attack against any target that is nearer to you than the target of the original attack. The damage die for this attack is a d4 instead of a d8.  
**Whip.** The Whip’s reach increases by 5 feet.  
***Painful Lash.*** While wielding your Whip, you can use your Bonus Action to lash a creature in its reach, who must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, its Speed is reduced by half and it cannot make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.  
**Knife.** Your Knife gains the Sap Mastery property. If you activate it, you can’t use any other Mastery property with it until the start of your next turn.  
***Intimidating Weapon.*** While wielding your Knife, you can use your Bonus Action to force a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature has the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn.

## Level 7: Venom Wrangler
You are experienced in dealing with venomous creatures and can brush off their attacks. You can cast Protection from Poison without expending a spell slot, and then can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
In addition, you can use your Dexterity score in place of Strength to determine the saving throw DC of your Unarmed Strikes when you take the Grapple option. Further, immediately after a creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with a melee attack, you can take a Reaction to attempt to Grapple the creature.

## Level 11: Outback Weapon Master
You are an unparalleled master of outback weaponry. When you use the Bonus Action of one of your Outback Weapon User features, you can temporarily enhance it:  
***Boomerang.*** You make two attacks with your Returning Strike, but not against the same target.  
***Whip.*** When a creature fails its saving throw against your Painful Lash, its Speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn and it cannot take Reactions. On a success, its Speed is reduced by half and it suffers no other effects.  
***Knife.*** While a creature has the Frightened condition from your Intimidating Weapon feature, the only actions it can take on its turn are Dash or Disengage.  
You can enhance a feature in one of these ways a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 15: Jolly Swagman
When you gain one of the Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned or Stunned conditions, you can use your Reaction to suppress the effects of that condition with your brash confidence and bravado alone. The suppressed condition resumes after 1 minute, or if you use this Reaction again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
