# Green Reaper
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Slay with Nature's Venom*  
Green Reapers are assassins who specialize in harnessing the toxic elements of flora and fauna. These Rangers often work as killers for hire utilizing their extensive knowledge to end lives discreetly or with gory panache, depending on the poison used and the client's wishes. Green Reapers exhibit a morbid curiosity when encountering a toxin they're unfamiliar with, typically followed by an enthusiastic application of the substance on their next foe.

## Level 3: Envenomed Attack
As a Bonus Action, you can apply a poison dose to a weapon or up to 20 pieces of ammunition. Once applied, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute. Your attacks with the poisoned item deal an extra 1d4 Poison damage on a hit.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
At Ranger level 11, the extra Poison damage increases to 2d4, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 3: Toxic Tradecraft
You gain a Poisoner's Kit, and you have proficiency with it. In addition, your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for ability checks with a Poisoner's Kit. If you lose the kit, you can harvest toxic flora and venomous fauna for 1 hour to magically create a replacement. This harvest can be performed during a Short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous Poisoner's Kit.  
Once per turn when you deal Poison damage to a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a spell slot (no action required). The attack deals an extra 1d6 Poison damage and the target gains the Poisoned condition until the end of your next turn. You may also add a Toxin Effect, chosen from the appropriate list below. All Toxin Effects last until the end of your next turn, unless its description states otherwise.

If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain at the end of your next turn, they vanish.
