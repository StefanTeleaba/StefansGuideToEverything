*Hunt Down Villains, Collect their Bounties*  
Bounty Hunting is a dangerous profession of apprehending fugitives. Rangers who adopt this archetype have trained extensively in the skills of tracking their quarry and capturing them.  
Bounty hunters become experts in the skill of restraining creatures and preventing their escape prior to being delivered to their benefactor. Consider whether your bounty hunter relies on magical means or gadgetry to restrain their targets. The choice is yours.

## Level 3: Bounty Hunter Spells
Your training as a Bounty Hunter ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Ranger level specified in the Bounty Hunter Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Quarry Tracker
You are an expert at tracking down your quarries from far distances, and capturing them alive. Your Favored Enemy feature improves in the following ways:  
***Known Target.*** You can target a creature with your Hunter’s Mark spell even if you can’t see it, and from any range, so long as it is on the same plane of existence. To do so, you must at least know what the creature looks like and its name or an alias it goes by.  
***Extra Damage.*** Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature with your Hunter’s Mark, the spell’s damage increases by 1d6.  
***Preserve Quarry.*** When the target of your Hunter’s Mark is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can use your Reaction to prevent it from dying, instead Knocking it Out. You can only do so if you can see the creature.

## Level 3: Restricting Strike
You have acquired machines or magic capable of restricting a creature’s movement from afar.  
Immediately before making a weapon attack, you can turn it into a Restricting Strike. If the attack hits, the target’s Speed is reduced to 0 for 1 minute. A creature within 5 feet of it can free the target by taking its action to make a successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC.  
A creature is immune to this effect if it is Huge or larger, or if it has Immunity to the Grappled condition.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 7: Sole Focus
At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to become hyper-aware of the target of your Hunter’s Mark and their tactics. Until the start of your next turn, you have Advantage on saving throws against spells and effects produced by the target, your attacks against it cannot have Disadvantage and the target has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to Hide from you. This awareness comes with a cost: until the start of your next turn, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks made against any other creature.

## Level 11: Restraining Strike
Your Restricting Strikes become tighter and more debilitating. While a creature’s Speed is reduced by your Restricting Strike feature, it also has the Restrained condition.

## Level 15: Master Bounty Hunter
You have become a master of your craft, and have fine tuned your specialised skills to maximise their effectiveness. You gain the following benefits:  
***Dual Concentration.*** Concentrating on Hunter’s Mark does not prevent you from concentrating on other Ranger spells.  
***Extra Damage.*** You deal the extra damage of your Quarry Tracker feature every time you deal damage with the Hunter’s Mark spell, not just once per turn.  
***Quick Reset.*** When you make a Restricting Strike and miss, you do not waste the use of the feature.
