# Primordial Archer
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Channel the Wrath of the Wilds*  
In the areas of Etharis where nature still holds sway, many cling to the ancient customs of woodland hunters and witches. Marking themselves with wild plants and bone needles, theirs is a tradition of cunning, cruelty, and reprisal against all trespassers. Unlike the Druids, these wood witches twist natural magic into hexes, imbuing their weapons with nature's fury.

## Level 3: Elemental Arrows
As a Bonus Action, you can imbue a Longbow or Shortbow with elemental energy for 1 minute. Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. For the duration, the imbued weapon deals damage of the selected type instead of its normal type and deals an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type when it hits. At the start of each of your turns, you can change this choice.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Herbal Lore
You gain an Herbalism Kit and are proficient with it. You can use the Herbalism Kit as a Bonus Action to stabilize an Unconscious creature within 5 feet of you that has 0 Hit Points as if using a Healer's Kit without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. If you take a Utilize action, an Unconscious creature within 5 feet of you that has 0 Hit Points gains 1 Hit Point instead.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 7: Weave the Elements
With 1 hour of work or when you finish a Long Rest, you can use an Herbalism Kit to mark yourself with elemental patterns. You gain Resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice until you finish a Long Rest: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.

## Level 11: Witching Arrows
You gain the ability to imbue curses into your arrows. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a ranged attack using a Longbow or Shortbow, you can expend a level 1+ spell slot to choose one of the following effects (no action required). The listed damage increases by 2d6 for each spell slot above 1.  
***Arcing Shot.*** Electricity crackles around the arrow. Make a ranged attack roll with the same weapon against a second creature within 30 feet of the first that is also within your range. Each creature hit takes 2d6 Lightning damage.  
***Entangling Shot.*** The wooden shaft of the arrow sprouts tiny green leaves. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 Piercing damage and has the Restrained condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes the damage only. A Restrained creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
***Hexing Shot.*** The magic surrounding your arrow clouds the mind of your target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 Psychic damage and gains the Charmed or Frightened condition for 1 minute (your choice). The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.  
***Viper Shot.*** The arrow transforms into a hissing serpent. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 Poison damage and has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

## Level 15: Primordial Magic
Taking damage can't break your Concentration on any Ranger spells you cast.  
In addition, you can take a Bonus Action to change the damage type you chose for the Weave the Elements feature to a different damage type in the list. When you do, you can choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 6d6 damage of the either damage type (your choice).  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
