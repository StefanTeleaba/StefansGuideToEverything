*v1.1*  

*Stalk and Cause Terror to Your Victims*  
You are the cause of that shiver that runs down a person’s spine when nothing appears to be there - that feeling of being watched, or more accurately, hunted. Barbarians of this path embrace dark powers over fear, gained from unnerving otherwordly sources that few dare name, and even fewer seek willingly.

## Level 3: Lurker in the Dark
You are at home within darkness, its shroud making you more difficult to detect and more frightening. If you make an ability check with either the Stealth or Intimidation skill while in Dim Light or Darkness, you add your Rage Damage bonus to the check’s total.

## Level 3: Curse of Victimhood
When you activate your Rage, you can curse one creature you can see within 30 feet to be your victim until your Rage ends, or until the creature dies or is targeted by the Remove Curse spell. While your Rage is active and you have no cursed targets, you can move the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet as a Bonus Action.  
Once per turn, when you hit a cursed target with an attack, it takes an extra 1d6 Psychic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier) or be subjected to one of the following effects until the start of your next turn. You choose which before the creature makes the save.  
***Afraid.*** The creature has the Frightened condition, as your frightful presence fills its mind.  
***Impotent.*** The creature’s attacks feel useless. It subtracts half your Barbarian level (round up) from the damage rolls of its attacks.  
***Unsteady.*** If the creature Moves on its turn, when it ends its turn it has the Prone condition, having inexplicably tripped.

## Level 6: Pursuit of the Unsated
While your Rage is active, your pursuit of your victims is nigh unstoppable, granting you the following benefits:  
***Uncontainable.*** When your Speed is reduced to 0 by an effect, such as the Restrained condition, any attempt you make to end that effect that would normally require an action only takes a Bonus Action for you.  
***Unrelenting Pursuit.*** You ignore Difficult Terrain and other effects that would cause you to Move more slowly, such as the Plant Growth spell, provided you are moving toward the target of your curse.  
***Victim Sight.*** You always know the location of the target of your Curse of Victimhood, and you have a special form of Truesight to a range of 60 feet, which can only be used to see the cursed creature.

## Level 10: Scopasthesia
While your Rage is active, nearby creatures have the uneasy feeling that something is right behind it, silently watching. When a creature within 30 feet of you Moves at least 5 feet away from you for the first time on a turn, you can take a Reaction to Teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target, as if you were right behind it all along. You do so immediately before the creature leaves its space, who must then choose to stay in its space or continue the Move. It if would trigger one on this turn, you can make an Opportunity Attack against the creature as part of the same Reaction.

## Level 14: Fear's Embodiment
While your Rage is active you become an embodiment of fear itself, unknowable and inescapable. You gain the following benefits until your Rage ends:  
***Fear Immunity.*** You have Immunity to the Frightened Condition.  
***Curse Improvement.*** When a creature fails its saving throw against your Curse of Victimhood, you can apply two effects to it, instead of one.  
***Cursed Strike.*** The Psychic damage you deal with Curse of Victimhood increases to 1d12.
