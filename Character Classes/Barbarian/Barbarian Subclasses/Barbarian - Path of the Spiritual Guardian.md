# Path of the Spiritual Guardian
*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - Subclasses Update*  
*This subclass was published on October 30th, 2025.*  

*Call on the Spirits for Combat Aid*  
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Spiritual Guardian call upon spirits—whether bestial spirits of nature, spirits of departed ancestors, or spirits of raw elemental power—to guide and protect them. When these Barbarians rage, they contact the realm of the spirits and call on them for aid.

## Level 3: Spiritual Protectors
Your Rage summons spectral warriors to your aid. While your Rage is active, when you hit a creature with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, it becomes the target of the spirits, which cause one of the following effects of your choice.  
***Distract.*** Until the start of your next turn, the target has Disadvantage attack rolls against targets other than you or another Barbarian who has this feature.  
***Protect.*** Until the end of the target’s next turn, the next time it hits a creature other than you with an attack roll, that creature has Resistance to the damage dealt by the attack.  
***Strike.*** The target takes an extra 1d6 damage, which can be Acid, Cold, Fire, Force, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice).

## Level 6: Spirit Shield
Your guardian spirits can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. While your Rage is active, when another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce that damage. To determine the amount the damage is reduced by, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.

## Level 10: Consult the Spirits
You gain the ability to consult with your guardian spirits. When you do so, you cast the Augury or Clairvoyance spell, without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of Clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your guardian spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.  
After you cast either spell in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 14: Vengeful Spirits
When you make an attack roll with a Melee weapon as part of the Attack action and roll 18–20 on the d20, you can make one additional attack roll with the same weapon as part of that action. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.

# Path of the Ancestral Guardian

Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.  
Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

## Level 3: Ancestral Protectors
Spectral warriors appear when you enter your Rage. While your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has Disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has Resistance to the damage of the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your Rage ends.

## Level 6: Spirit Shield
The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. While your Rage is active and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your Reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6. The damage reduction increases by an extra 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and level 14 (4d6).

## Level 10: Consult the Spirits
You gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. You can cast the Augury or Clairvoyance spell without using a spell slot or material components. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. After you cast either spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 14: Vengeful Ancestors
Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes the same amount of Force damage.
