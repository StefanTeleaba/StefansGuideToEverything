# Path of the Wrathful Dead
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Channel the Rage of the Unquiet Dead*  
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Wrathful Dead commune with the spirits of the deceased and channel their spectral powers. These Barbarians are often preoccupied with the dead whispering in their ears, which urge them to act upon the whims and emotions of the haunting spirits. Some who walk this path learn to master the powers gifted to them; others find they've become servants to the unending chorus clamoring for their attention.

## Level 3: Rage of the Dead
Your Rage taps into the endless fury of the unquiet dead. While your Rage is active, you take on aspects of restless spirits and you gain the following benefits.  
***Shadow Form.*** You ignore Difficult Terrain. In addition, you can move through the space of any creature, but you can't end your move in an occupied space.  
***Shadowy Sidestep.*** Your Speed increases by 10 feet, and Opportunity Attacks have Disadvantage against you.  
***Spectral Sight.*** You see creatures and objects within 120 feet that have the Invisible condition as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane.

## Level 3: Final Night Catharsis
You are overcome by an emotion a nearby spirit experienced at its death. You gain one of the following options of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your choice.  
***Hate.*** When you miss with an attack roll against a creature, you have Advantage on the next attack roll you make against it before the end of your next turn.  
***Jealousy.*** When a creature you have Grappled is about to make an ability check to end the Grappled condition on itself, you can take a Reaction to impose Disadvantage on that roll.  
***Terror.*** While you are Bloodied, you can take a Bonus Action to take the Dash or Disengage action.

## Level 6: Dark Doom Revisited
Once per active Rage, you can take a Magic action to channel a traumatic death. When you do, choose one of the following options.  
***Contamination.*** At the start of their turn, each creature of your choice in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or take Poison damage and gain the Poisoned condition for 1 minute.  
To determine the Poison damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. An affected creature can use an action to end the Poisoned condition on itself.  
***Hypothermia.*** At the start of their turn, each creature of your choice in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or take Cold damage and have its Speed halved for 1 minute.  
To determine the Cold damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. A creature can use an action to end this effect on itself.  
***Immolation.*** At the start of their turn, each creature of your choice in a 15-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or take Fire damage.  
To determine the Fire damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. As an action, a creature can extinguish the fire on itself by giving itself the Prone condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.

## Level 10: Death Is but a Door
Your familiarity with death has left you resistant to its call. You gain the following benefits.  
***Hard to Kill.*** You have Advantage on Death Saving Throws. In addition, you must fail four Death Saving Throws to die instead of three as normal.  
***Return the Spirit.*** You can call the spirits of the deceased to restore life essence to a nearby creature. You can cast the Cure Wounds, Raise Dead, or Revivify spell without providing Material components. When you do, you gain 1 Exhaustion level for Cure Wounds, 2 Exhaustion levels for Revivify, and 3 Exhaustion levels for Raise Dead. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this feature.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend two uses of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.

## Level 14: Powered by Pathos
Your Rage is empowered by the overwhelming emotions of the unquiet dead. Your Final Night Catharsis feature grants an additional effect based on the chosen emotion.  
***Hate.*** While your Rage is active, your attacks with weapons and Unarmed Strikes score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.  
***Jealousy.*** Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your Rage is active, you can take a Reaction to summon spectral assailants to Grapple the creature. The creature makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failure, the creature has the Grappled condition until the end of its turn. On a successful save, the creature is not Grappled; however, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot for that creature until the end of its turn.  
***Terror.*** Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your Rage is active, you can take a Reaction to make that creature terrified until the start of its next turn. A terrified creature's Speed is halved and Opportunity Attacks against it have Advantage.
