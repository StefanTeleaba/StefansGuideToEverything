[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)

Barbarians of the Path of the Horde develop their power by forming strong bonds with their comrades, and by exclusively attacking in groups. Their connection to their horde results in a mystical link, allowing the group to freely share tactics, resiliences and skills.

## Level 3: Group Demoralize
While accompanied by your horde, you are especially imposing. You have proficiency with the Intimidation skill. If you already have this proficiency, choose another skill from the list available to Barbarians at level 1. If you make a check with the Intimidation skill while two or more of your allies are within 5 feet of you, you have Expertise with the check.

## Level 3: Exploit Defenses
You can reveal weaknesses in your enemiesâ€™ defense, granting your horde the perfect opportunity to strike. Once oer turn when you hit a creature with a melee attack while your Rage is active, you can mark that creature until the start of your next turn. When one of your allies makes an attack against a marked target, you can grant that creature a bonus to hit equal to your Rage Damage bonus (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals extra damage equal to half your Barbarian level (round up) and the mark disappears.

## Level 6: Horde's Resilience
When you activate your Rage, you can select a number of creatures equal to your Rage Damage bonus that are within 30 feet of you. Until the Rage ends, they gain Resistance to one damage type that you have Resitance to of your choice.

## Level 10: Horde's Assault
You can direct your fury into your horde, causing your allies to strike. When you activate your Rage, or as a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can direct a willing creature within 30 feet of you to use its Reaction to make a weapon attack against a target you can see, provided the target is within range.

## Level 14: Horde's Surge
When one of your allies within 30 feet of you reduces a hostile creature to 0 Hit Points, you can immediately use your Reaction to make a weapon attack.
