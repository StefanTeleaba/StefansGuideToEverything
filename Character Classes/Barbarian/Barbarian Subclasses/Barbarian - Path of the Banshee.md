*v1.2*  

*Scream with Undead Fury*  
Banshees are woeful undead, terrorizing all that dare come venture near with its deadly wail. You have somehow taken on the terrible traits of a Banshee, whether through training, an encounter with a banshee you survived or some other origin. Barbarians of this path embody physical characteristics of the Banshee: pale skin, gaunt features and moments of translucency.

## Level 3: Horrifying Visage
Your frightening appearance makes those around you uneasy. You gain proficiency with the Intimidation skill. If you already have this proficiency, you gain Expertise.

## Level 3: Banshee's Scream
You gain the capability to infuse the Banshee’s horrible scream into your Rage. As a part of the Bonus Action you use to activate or maintain your Rage, you can unleash a Banshee’s Scream in a 15-foot Cone originating from your space. Choose one of the following options when you activate your Rage.  
The saving throw DC for these effects is equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus and your Strength modifier.  
***Shockwave Scream.*** Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you. Objects that aren’t being worn or carried are automatically pushed.  
***Debilitating Scream.*** Each creature in the area that can hear you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Deafened condition until the start of your next turn. While Deafened in this way, it cannot take Opportunity Attacks and has Disadvantage on saving throws to maintain Concentration.  
***Horrifying Scream.*** Each creature in the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn.

## Level 6: Momentary Incorporeality
You have developed a limited form of the Banshee’s incorporeality, which you can activate for moments at a time in the following ways.  
***Incorporeal Defense.*** When you are hit by an attack that deals Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to gain Resistance to that instance of damage. If your Rage is active, you gain Immunity instead.  
***Incorporeal Movement.*** As a Bonus Action, you can gain the ability to move through creatures and objects as if they were Difficult Terrain until the end of your next turn. If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 1d10 Force damage.  
You can use one of these options a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum once). You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Dreadful Screech
Your Banshee’s Scream has become more powerful. You can now choose to cause the scream to manifest as a 5-foot wide and 30-foot long Line, instead of a Cone. In addition, your scream options improve in the following ways:  
***Shockwave Scream.*** Creatures that fail their saving throw additionally have the Prone condition.  
***Debilitating Scream.*** Creatures that fail their saving throw additionally have the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn.  
***Horrifying Scream.*** Creatures that fail their saving throw have a Speed of 0 while they have the Frightened condition from this feature.

## Level 14: Banshee Manifestation
You can now choose which Banshee’s Scream option to use each time you use the Bonus Action to screech. Additionally, you have learned to channel the Banshee’s most dreadful and dangerous ability: its Wail. You learn the following additional Banshee’s Scream option:  
***Wail.*** Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or take 8d6 Psychic damage, taking half as much damage on a success. If this effect reduces the creature’s Hit Points to fewer than your Barbarian level, it instead drops to 0 Hit Points.  
Once you use this Banshee’s Scream option, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
