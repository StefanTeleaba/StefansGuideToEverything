Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.

## Level 3: Magic Awareness
As an action, you can cast the Detect Magic spell without spending a spell slot. Strength is your spellcasting ability for it. When you do so, the range is 60 feet and you don’t need to Concentrate on it. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1) and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Wild Surge
The magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your Rage, roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magical effect produced. If the effect requires a save, the DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier.

## Level 6: Bolstering Magic
You can harness your wild magic to bolster yourself or a companion. As an action, you can touch a creature and confer one of the following benefits of your choice to it:  
***Might.*** Whenever the creature makes a D20 Test it can roll a d4 and add it to the result. This effect lasts for 10 minutes.  
***Mana.*** The creature rolls a d4 and regains an expended spell slot of the level equal to the number rolled or lower (the creature’s choice). Once a creature receives this benefit, it can’t receive it again until they finish a Long Rest.  
You can this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1) and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Unstable Backlash
When you are imperiled during your rage, the magic within you can lash out. When you take damage or fail a saving throw while your Rage is active, you can use your Reaction to roll on the Wild Magic table and immediately produce the effect. This effect replaces the active Wild Magic effect.

## Level 14: Controlled Surge
Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to unleash. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
