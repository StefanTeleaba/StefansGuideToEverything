Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.  
Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestorsâ€™ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.

## Level 3: Ancestral Protectors
Spectral warriors appear when you enter your Rage. While your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has Disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has Resistance to the damage of the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your Rage ends.

## Level 6: Spirit Shield
The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. While your Rage is active and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your Reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6. The damage reduction increases by an extra 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and level 14 (4d6).

## Level 10: Consult the Spirits
You gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. You can cast the Augury or Clairvoyance spell without using a spell slot or material components. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. After you cast either spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 14: Vengeful Ancestors
Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes the same amount of Force damage.
