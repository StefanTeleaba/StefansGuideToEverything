# Path of the Spell Scorned
*Cthulhu by Torchlight v5.5*

*“My magic? It's the magic of stabbing things in the face. Works well in my experience.” — Oreg the Slayer*

*The Path of the Spell Scorned awakens a mote of antimagic within the soul of its adherents. These elite warriors steel themselves against magical effects. Some are specially trained bodyguards, tasked with protecting the elite mages of arcane academies or the high priests of religious orders. Others are demon hunters, their resistance allowing them to overcome the foul magic that strikes down lesser warriors.*

## Level 3: Instinctual Divination
You gain an intuitive sense about the supernatural facets of the world. When you take the Study action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Religion) check, you can make it as a Wisdom (Survival) check instead.

## Level 3: Spell Hammer
You sheathe your weapons in crackling energy that is particularly baneful to creatures from other worlds, those that wield magic, or those that are capable of tremendous destruction. Once per turn while your Rage is active, you can deal double your Rage Damage bonus to a target you hit with a Strength-based attack. If the target has Legendary Actions, can cast spells, or was summoned, you can deal triple your Rage Damage bonus instead.

## Level 3: Spell Shield
You exert a void around you that consumes spells. While your Rage is active, you radiate a spell-consuming aura in a 30-foot Emanation that originates from you. You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws against spells equal to your Rage Damage bonus.

## Level 6: Sunder the Weave
You always have the Counterspell spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components while your Rage is active, and your spellcasting ability for it is Strength. As part of the Reaction you take to cast the spell, you can move up to your Speed and make one attack with a weapon against the target of the spell.  
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 10: Bolstering Howl
When you or another creature that can hear you takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage. In addition, the target gains Resistance to that damage type until the end of the current turn.

## Level 14: Dimensional Duel
You always have the Banishment spell prepared. When you activate your Rage or as a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can cast Banishment without a spell slot or components and while your Rage is active, and your spellcasting ability for it is Strength. You can maintain Concentration while your Rage is active. You can target up to three creatures when you cast Banishment this way. In addition, you can choose to pursue the creatures you banish. If you do so, the targets you banished don't have the Incapacitated condition for the spell's duration, and you travel with them to a demiplane. The demiplane is an empty room 30 to 200 feet in each dimension (you choose when you cast the spell) and made of wood or stone (your choice). You must create enough space for you and the targets, or the spell ends. The room is filled with Bright Light. When the spell ends, if you traveled with any targets, you and any dropped objects reappear in the space you left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
