# Path of the Fractured
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Two Personalities Are Better than One*  
Barbarians are defined by their rage, channeling it to unleash brief but potent destruction. Few are brave or unwise enough to study esoteric psychological techniques that split their rage from the rest of their psyche, dividing their identity into two parts: ego and id. When their ego is in control, the Fractured—as these Barbarians are known—possess self-control and cunning beyond most other Barbarians. When they allow their id to take control, their countenance turns monstrous and their bodies swell with the power of rage made physically manifest.

## Level 3: Face of Rage
When you activate your Rage, your countenance distorts and your body swells. Creatures that haven't witnessed your transformation, now or previously, don't recognize you. In addition, while your Rage is active, you gain the following benefits:
- You can roll 1d8 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike, and whenever you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.
- When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can push it 10 feet or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.
- You count as one size larger when determining the success or failure of a Grapple, and when you make an Unarmed Strike, your reach is 5 feet greater than normal.

## Level 3: Mask of Civility
You are proficient in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Persuasion, or Religion. In addition, you gain proficiency with one type of Artisan's Tools of your choice or you know one language of your choice.

## Level 6: Brains and Brawn
While your Rage is not active, you have Resistance to Psychic damage. While your Rage is active, you have Resistance to every damage type except Force and Psychic.

## Level 10: Cunning and Brutal
While your Rage is not active, you can take the Disengage or Help action as a Bonus Action. While your Rage is active, your attack rolls with Unarmed Strikes score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

## Level 14: Better Half
When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead, and you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Hit Point maximum. In addition, if your Rage is active, your Rage ends. If your Rage was not active, you immediately activate your Rage (even if you have no remaining uses of your Rage). If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain after 1 minute, they vanish.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
