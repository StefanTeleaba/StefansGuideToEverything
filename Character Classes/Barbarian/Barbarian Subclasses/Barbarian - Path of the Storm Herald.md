*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - Subclasses Update*  
*This subclass was published on October 30th, 2025.*  

*Wield the Fury of the Storm*  
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to harness their Rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them like a storm. When in their Rage, these Barbarians tap into the elemental forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.

## Level 3: Storm Aura
Whenever you activate your Rage, choose Desert, Sea, or Tundra. You extend an aura in a 10-foot Emanation originating from yourself for the duration of your Rage.  
Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your Rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a Bonus Action. Your aura’s effect depends on the chosen environment, as detailed below.  
If your aura’s effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency bonus plus your Constitution modifier.  
***Desert.*** When this effect is activated, roll a number of d4s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. Each creature in the aura must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take Fire damage equal to the number rolled. You can choose one creature you can see in your aura to automatically succeed on this saving throw.  
***Sea.*** When this effect is activated, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. You can then hurl a bolt of lightning at one other creature you can see within your aura. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking Lightning damage equal to the number rolled on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
***Tundra.*** When this effect is activated, roll a number of d4s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. You can choose one other creature you can see within your aura to harry with icy spirits. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or it subtracts the number rolled from the next damage roll it makes before the start of your next turn.

## Level 6: Storm Soul
The storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn’t active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura the last time you entered your Rage.  
***Desert.*** You gain Resistance to Fire damage. As a Magic action, you can touch a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried by anyone else fand cause the object to start burning.  
***Sea.*** You gain Resistance to Lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.  
***Tundra.*** You gain Resistance to Cold damage. As a Magic action, you can touch water and turn a 5-foot Cube of it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the Cube.

## Level 10: Shielding Storm
You can use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice within your Storm Aura has the damage Resistance you have from the Storm Soul feature.

## Level 14: Raging Storm
The power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you choose for your Storm Aura.  
***Desert.*** Once per turn, when a creature you can see fails its saving throw against your Storm Aura effect, you can cause it to start burning for 1 minute or until your Rage ends. A burning creature takes an extra 1d4 Fire damage (2d4 Fire damage total) at the start of each of its turns.  
***Sea.*** Whether the target fails or succeeds on its saving throw against your Storm Aura effect, a bolt of lightning leaps from the target to another target of your choice, which must be within 30 feet of the first target. The new target makes the same Dexterity saving throw as the first target.  
***Tundra.*** Once per turn, when a creature you can see fails its saving throw against your Storm Aura effect, you can cause it to take 2d4 Cold damage and its Speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

Typical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.  
Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect the natural realm. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges founded in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

## Level 3: Storm Aura
While your Rage is active, a storm whips around you in a 10 foot Emanation. As part of the Bonus Action you use to activate or maintain your Rage, you can cause one of the following effects. You choose which when you activate your Rage. If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus and your Strength modifier.  
***Desert.*** Each creature of your choice within the Emanation takes Fire damage equal to 1d6 plus your Rage Damage bonus.  
***Sea.*** You choose one other creature you can see within the Emanation. It must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, it takes Lightning damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength modifier and half as much on a successful save. This damage increases by 1d8 at level 10, level 15, and at level 20.  
***Tundra.*** Each creature of your choice within the Emanation gains Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d6 plus your Rage Damage bonus, which last until your Rage ends.

## Level 6: Storm Soul
The storm grants you benefits even when your Storm Aura isn't active. Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest choose one of the following effects, which lasts until you finish your next Short or Long Rest:  
***Desert.*** You have Resistance to Fire damage and you don’t suffer effects caused by extreme heat, and as an action you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.  
***Sea.*** You have Resistance to Lightning damage, you can breathe underwater, and you have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.  
***Tundra.*** You have Resistance to Cold damage and you don’t suffer effects caused by extreme cold, and as an action you can touch a 5-foot Cube of water and turn it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the Cube.

## Level 10: Shielding Storm
You learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has Resistance to the damage type of your Storm Soul feature while it is within your Storm Aura.

## Level 14: Raging Storm
The power of your Storm Aura grows mightier, lashing out at your foes.  
***Desert.*** Immediately after a creature within the Emanation hits you with an attack, you can use your Reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature takes Fire damage equal to your Barbarian level.  
***Sea.*** When you hit a creature within the Emanation with an attack, you can use your Reaction to force that creature to make a Strength save. On a failed save, the creature takes an extra 2d6 Cold damage and has the Prone condition.  
***Tundra.*** Whenever you activate the effect of your Storm Aura, you choose one creature you can see within the Emanation. That creature must succeed on a Strength save, or has its Speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.
