Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.  
Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might or determine it by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.

## Level 3: Form of the Beast
While your Rage is active, the bestial power within you manifests into a natural weapon, which counts as a Simple Melee Weapon for you. You choose the weapon’s form each time you enter your Rage, and you can use its Mastery property:  
***Bite.*** Your mouth transforms into a bestial muzzle or great mandibles (your choice). It deals 1d8 Piercing damage on a hit and has the Sap Mastery property. Once per turn, when you damage a creature with it, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Constitution Modifier, provided you are Bloodied.  
***Claws.*** Each of your hands transforms into a claw, which you can use as a weapon if it’s empty. It deals 1d6 Slashing damage on a hit and has the Slow Mastery property. Once per turn, when you use the Attack action with it, you can make an extra attack as part of the same action.  
***Tail.*** You grow a lashing, spiny tail, which deals 1d8 Piercing damage on a hit and has the Reach property and the Topple Mastery property. If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to swipe your tail between you and the attack. Roll a d8 and add the result to your Armor Class for triggering attack.

## Level 6: Bestial Soul
The feral power within you increases.  
***Supernatural Beast.*** Whenever you deal damage with your natural weapon, you can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.  
Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you finish your next Short or Long Rest.
- You have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed, and you can breathe underwater.  
- You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed and you can climb difficult surfaces including upside down on ceilings without needing to make an ability check.  
- Once per turn when you jump you can make a Strength (Athletics) check and extend your jump by a number of feet equal to the check’s total.

## Level 10: Infectious Fury
When you hit a creature with the natural weapons of your Form of the Beast, you can curse your target with rabid fury. It makes a Wisdom save (DC equal to 8 plus your Strength Modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save it has one of the following curses:  
***Confusion.*** The target must use its Reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see.  
***Dread.*** The target takes 2d12 Psychic damage.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier, and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 14: Call the Hunt
The beast within you grows so powerful that you can spread its ferocity to others and gain resilience from them joining your hunt. When you enter your Rage, you can choose a number of willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1). You gain 5 Temporary Hit Points for each creature that accepts this feature. While your Rage is active, once on their turns, the chosen creatures can deal an extra 1d6 damage on an attack they make. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength Modifier (minimum of 1) and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
