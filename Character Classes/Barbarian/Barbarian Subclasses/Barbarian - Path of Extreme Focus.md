*Be Focussed, Precise and Intentional*  
Barbarians of the Path of Extreme Focus are often raised in environments under threat of psionic monsters, such as mind flayers or aboleths. They train in mental disciplines which allow them to fortify their minds against these threats. When they rage, instead of channeling emotion, these barbarians channel determination and focus, sharpening their senses and permitting greater control of their movements.

## Level 3: Focussed Rage
When you activate your Rage, you enter an extremely attentive and focussed state. You gain one of the following benefits of your choice until the rage ends:  
***Attentive.*** You gain a +5 bonus to ability checks using the Insight and Perception skills.  
***Mental Protection.*** You add your Rage Damage bonus to your Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.  
***Critical Focus.*** Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed Strikes score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19-20 on the d20.  
When you use your Bonus Action to extend your rage, you can choose to switch your current benefit for another.

## Level 3: Calculated Recklessness
Your heightened focus grants you the capacity to be more thoughtful with your reckless attacks, allowing you to more precisely calculate risk and reward. If you miss with an attack roll using Strength while not benefiting from your Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to activate Reckless Attack and re-roll the attack.  
You can do so even if the attack was not the first one you made on your turn.

## Level 10: Enhanced Control
You have gained the ability to cleanse your mind of mality, and can cleanse the minds of your allies as well. When you start your turn with the Charmed, Frightened or Stunned conditions, you can immediately end one of those conditions by emptying your mind (no action required).  
Alternatively, you can use your Bonus Action to touch a creature with one of these conditions and immediately end it on them, as you empty their mind and help them regain control.  
You can end a condition in this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 14: Perfected Mind
You have perfected your control over your mind, making it impenetrable to your foes and allowing you to focus on multiple things at once. While your Rage is active, you no longer have to choose between your Focussed Rage options, and simultaneously gain the benefits of all three.  
In addition, while your Rage is active you gain the benefits of the Mind Blank spell.
