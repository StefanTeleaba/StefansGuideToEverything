*Mold Psionic Force for Creation and Destruction*  

*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - The Psion*  
*This subclass was published on May 27th, 2025.*  

A Psykinetic controls their psionic powers like a malleable force. They bend their telekinetic energies into sturdy barriers and strike with the force of a battering ram.

## Level 3: Psykinetic Spells
When you reach a Psion level specified in the Psykinetic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Telekinetic Techniques
When you use your Telekinetic Propel, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.  
***Boost.*** The target's Speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.  
***Disorient.*** The target can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.  
***Telekinetic Bolt.*** If the target fails the saving throw, it takes Force damage equal to the number rolled on the Psionic Energy Die.  

## Level 6: Empowered Attack Mode
While your Attack Mode is active, you gain a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover, and when you cast a Psion spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

## Level 6: Rebounding Field
When you cast Shield in response to being hit by an attack roll and cause the triggering attack to miss, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to launch the force back at the attacker. The attacker makes a Dexterity saving throw. Roll two Psionic Energy Dice. On a failed save, the attacker takes Force damage equal to the amount rolled and you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to that amount. On a successful save, the attacker takes half as much damage only.

## Level 10: Enhanced Telekinetic Crush
When you cast Telekinetic Crush, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to modify the spell so that whether a creature fails or succeeds on the saving throw against the spell, its Speed is halved until the start of your next turn.

## Level 14: Heightened Telekinesis
When you cast Telekinesis, you can expend four Psionic Energy Dice to modify the spell so that it doesn't require Concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and you can target Gargantuan creatures and objects.
