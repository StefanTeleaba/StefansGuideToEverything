# Psykinetic
*Mold Psionic Force for Creation and Destruction*  

*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - Psion Update*  
*This subclass was published on October 2nd, 2025.*  

A Psykinetic controls their psionic powers like a malleable force. They bend their telekinetic energies into sturdy barriers and strike with the force of a battering ram.

## Level 3: Psykinetic Spells
When you reach a Psion level specified in the Psykinetic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Psykinetic Spells**  
| Psion Level | Spells                                          |
|:-----------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| 3           | Cloud of Daggers, Levitate, Shield, Thunderwave |
| 5           | Slow, Telekinetic Crush                         |
| 7           | Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, Stone Shape         |
| 9           | Telekinesis, Wall of Force                      |

## Level 3: Stronger Telekinesis
When you cast Mage Hand, its range increases by 30 feet when you cast it, and the hand can carry up to 20 pounds.

## Level 3: Telekinetic Techniques
When you use Telekinetic Propel, you can roll 1d4 and use the number rolled instead of expending a Psionic Energy Die.  
In addition, when a target fails the saving throw against your Telekinetic Propel, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.  
***Boost.*** The target’s Speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.  
***Disorient.*** The target can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.  
***Telekinetic Bolt.*** The target takes Force damage equal to the number rolled on the Psionic Energy Die.

## Level 6: Destructinve Trance
At the start of your turn, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to enter a destructive state. For the next 10 minutes, you gain a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover, and when you cast a Psion spell that expends a spell slot, you can roll your Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to one damage roll of that spell. This roll doesn’t expend the Psionic Energy Die.

## Level 6: Rebounding Field
When you cast Shield in response to being hit by an attack roll and cause the triggering attack to miss, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to launch the force back at the attacker. The attacker makes a Dexterity saving throw. Roll one Psionic Energy Die. On a failed save, the attacker takes Force damage equal to the amount rolled plus your Intelligence modifier. On a successful save, the attacker takes half as much damage only. Whether the target fails or succeeds on the saving throw, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the amount of damage dealt.

## Level 10: Enhanced Telekinetic Crush
When you cast Telekinetic Crush, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to modify the spell so that whether a creature fails or succeeds on the saving throw against the spell, its Speed is halved until the start of your next turn. In addition, you can roll the expended Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to one damage roll of the spell.

## Level 14: Heightened Telekinesis
You can cast Telekinesis without expending a spell slot by instead expending four Psionic Energy Dice. When you cast Telekinesis without expending a spell slot using this feature, you can modify the spell so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and you can target Gargantuan creatures and objects.
