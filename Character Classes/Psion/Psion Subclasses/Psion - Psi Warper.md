*Warp Space with the Power of Your Mind*  

*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - The Psion*  
*This subclass was published on May 27th, 2025.*  

Psi Warpers tune their psionic powers to manipulating the space between objects. Capable of teleporting across the battlefield and creating vacuums in space, a Psi Warper is never in one place for too long.

## Level 3: Psi Warper Spells
When you reach a Psion level specified in the Psi Warper Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Teleportation
You can cast Misty Step without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also restore your use of it by expending one Psionic Energy Die (no action required).

## Level 3: Warp Propel
When a target fails its saving throw against your Telekinetic Propel, instead of pushing it, you can teleport the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you that is horizontal to you.

## Level 6: Warp Space
When you cast Shatter, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to modify the spell so that the radius of the spell's Sphere becomes 20 feet.  
In addition, creatures that fail the saving throw against the spell are pulled straight toward the center of the Sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to center of the Sphere as possible.

## Level 6: Teleporter Combat
Immediately after you cast Misty Step, you can cast one of your Psion cantrips that has a casting time of an action as part of the Bonus Action.

## Level 10: Duplicitous Target
When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die and choose a willing creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself that doesn't have the Incapacitated condition. You and the willing creature teleport, swapping places with each other. The creature then becomes the target of the attack roll.

## Level 14: Mass Teleportation
As a Magic action, you expend four Psionic Energy Dice and choose Huge or smaller creatures within 30 feet of yourself, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures is teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 150 feet of you. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC is unaffected.
