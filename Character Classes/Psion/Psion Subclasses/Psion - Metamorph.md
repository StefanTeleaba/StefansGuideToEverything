*This subclass was published on October 2nd, 2025.*  

Your mastery of psionic powers turns inward. Your own flesh becomes like clay to you, and you mold it into the perfect vessel for your psionic powers. Experience in manipulating your life energy also enables you to adjust the life force of friends and foes.

## Level 3: Metamorph Spells
When you reach a Psion level specified in the Metamorph Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Mutable Form
As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to psionically stretch your limbs for 1 minute. Roll the expended Psionic Energy Die and gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). In addition, you gain the following benefits while this feature is active.  
***Reach.*** Your reach increases by 5 feet.  
***Speed.*** Your Speed increases by 5 feet.  
***Touch.*** When you cast a spell that has a range of Touch and a casting time of an action, you can make the spell’s range 10 feet.

## Level 3: Organic Weapons
You can shape your limbs into weapons. As a Magic action, you can reform your free hand into one of the following organic weapons: Bone Blade, Flesh Maul, or Viscera Launcher. When you take the Attack action, you can use this feature before you make the attack roll. Your limb retains the form of the organic weapon until you take a Magic action to change it into another organic weapon, you have the Unconscious condition, or you return the limb to its previous form (no action required).  
Whenever you attack with the weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity.  
***Bone Blade.*** A blade made of bone springs from your forearm or extends from your hand. The blade counts as a Simple Melee weapon with the Finesse property, and it deals 1d8 Piercing damage on a hit. You have Advantage on the attack roll you make with the blade if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition.  
***Flesh Maul.*** Your fist and forearm coalesce into a hardened mass of flesh and bone. The maul counts as a Simple Melee weapon and deals 1d10 Bludgeoning damage on a hit. A creature hit by the maul has Disadvantage on the next Strength or Constitution saving throw it makes before the start of its next turn.  
***Viscera Launcher.*** Your hand and forearm transform into a crossbow made of muscle and sinew that fires bolts of bile. The launcher counts as a Simple Ranged weapon with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet, and it deals 1d6 Acid damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using the launcher, you can deal an extra 1d6 Acid damage to the target.

## Level 6: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.  
In addition, you can cast one of your Psion cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

## Level 6: Flesh Weaver
When you use Mutable Form, you can expend an additional Psionic Energy Die to gain the following benefits while the feature is active.  
***Organic Defense.*** You gain a +2 bonus to AC.  
***Empowered Healing.*** When you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the number of Hit Points regained.

## Level 10: Improved Mutable Form
When you use Mutable Form, the duration increases to 10 minutes and you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until Mutable Form ends.  
***Stony Epidermis.*** You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain Concentration. In addition, choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Piercing, Poison, Slashing, or Thunder. You gain Resistance to the chosen damage type.  
***Superior Stride.*** While you aren’t wearing armor, you can take the Dash action as a Bonus Action, and you have a Climb Speed and Swim Speed equal to your Speed.  
***Unnatural Flexibility.*** You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and your body—along with any equipment you’re wearing or carrying—becomes pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or end the Grappled condition.

## Level 14: Life-Bending Weapons
Your weapon becomes wreathed in negative energy, and you radiate life-mending psionic energy. When you hit a target with an attack roll using your Organic Weapon, roll one Psionic Energy Die. The target takes extra Necrotic damage equal to the number rolled. This roll doesn’t expend the die.  
Alternatively, when you hit a creature with your Organic Weapon, you can instead expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it. The target takes extra Necrotic damage equal to the roll, and each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you regains Hit Points equal the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.
