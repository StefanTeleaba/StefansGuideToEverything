## Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned how to channel magical energy using the power of your mind. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Psion spells, which appear in the Psion spell list later in the class's description.  
**Cantrips.** You know two Psion cantrips of your choice. Minor Illusion and Telekinetic Fling are recommended.  
Whenever you gain a Psion level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Psion cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Psion levels 10 and 14, you learn another Psion cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Psion Features table.  
**Spell Slots.** The Psion Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 Psion spells. Charm Person, Command, Dissonant Whispers, and Mage Armor are recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Psion levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Psion Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Psion spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Psion, your list of prepared spells can include six Psion spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.  
If another Psion feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Psion spells for you.  
**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Psion level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Psion spell of an eligible level.  
**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Psion spells.  
**Psionic Spellcasting.** When you cast a Psion spell, that spell doesn't require a Verbal or Material component, even if the spell includes "V" or "M" in its "Components" entry, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in the spell.

## Level 1: Psionic Power
You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice. Your Psion level determines the die size and number of Psionic Energy Dice you have, as shown in the Energy Die and Number of Dice columns of the Psion Features table.  
Your Psionic Energy Dice are used to enhance or fuel certain Psion features. You start with two such features: Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection, each of which is detailed below. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Dice, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.  
You regain one expended Psionic Energy Die when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.  
Some features that use Psionic Energy Dice require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.  
**Telekinetic Propel.** As a Bonus Action, choose one Large or smaller creature other than you that you can see within 30 feet of yourself, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed or pulled (your choice) up to a number of feet straight away from yourself equal to 5 times the number rolled. The die is expended only if the target fails the saving throw.  
**Telepathic Connection.** You have Telepathy with a range of 5 feet. As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it. For a number of minutes equal to your Psion level, the range of your Telepathy increases by a number of feet equal to 10 times the number rolled.

## Level 1: Subtle Telekinesis
You know the Mage Hand cantrip. You can cast it without Somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand Invisible when you cast it.

## Level 2: Psionic Discipline
You learn further psionic techniques that are fueled by your Psionic Energy Dice. You gain two disciplines of your choice, such as Expanded Awareness and Id Insinuation. Disciplines are described in the "Psionic Discipline Options" section later in this class's description.  
You can use only one Discipline each turn and only once per turn unless otherwise noted in one of those options.  
Whenever you gain a Psion level, you can replace one of your Psionic Discipline options with one you don't know. You gain two more options at Psion level 10 and two more at Psion level 17.

## Level 2: Psionic Modes
You have honed your psionic powers to act as both a shield and a weapon in battle. As a Bonus Action, you can choose one of the following modes, granting you certain benefits for 1 minute or until you use this feature again:  
**Attack Mode.** Damage from your weapon attacks, Psion spells, and Psion features ignores Resistance to Psychic damage. In addition, when you roll damage for a spell, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to reroll a number of damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.  
**Defense Mode.** You have Resistance to Psychic damage. In addition, when you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die; roll the Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning a failure into a success.  
You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 5: Psionic Restoration
When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Psionic Energy Dice, but no more than a number equal to half your number of dice (round down). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 7: Psionic Surge
When you roll Initiative, you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice and regain one expended use of Psionic Modes.

## Level 20: Enkindled Lifeforce
Once per turn, when you expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it for a Psion feature or Psionic Discipline, you can expend two of your Hit Point Dice to roll two additional Psionic Energy Dice and add the numbers rolled to the total.


### Psionic Discipline Options
Psionic Discipline options appear in alphabetical order.

**Biofeedback**  
When you cast a Psion spell from the Necromancy or Transmutation school, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it. You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

**Destructive Thoughts**  
When you cast a Psion spell from the Conjuration or Evocation school and a creature you can see succeeds on a saving throw against the spell, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it. The creature takes Psychic damage equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

**Devilish Tongue**  
When you take the Influence action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Ego Whip**  
When a creature provokes an Opportunity Attack from you by leaving your reach, you can take a Reaction to roll one Psionic Energy Die and force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target's Speed is reduced by 10 feet and it subtracts the number rolled from the next damage roll it makes before the end of its next turn. The die is expended only if the target fails the saving throw.

**Expanded Awareness**  
When you take the Search action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Id Insinuation**  
When you cast a Psion spell from the Enchantment or Illusion school that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can expend two Psionic Energy Dice and roll one Psionic Energy Die. One target of the spell you can see subtracts the number rolled from its saving throw against the spell.

**Inerrant Aim**  
When you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll, potentially turning the miss into a hit. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.

**Psionic Backlash**  
Immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll two Psionic Energy Dice, and subtract the number rolled on each die from the total. In addition, you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes Psychic damage equal to the amount rolled on the two Psionic Energy Dice.

**Psionic Guards**  
At the start of your turn, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die. Until the start of your next turn, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Advantage on Intelligence saving throws. If you are Charmed or Frightened when you use this discipline, the condition ends on you.  
When you use Psionic Guards, you can also use a different Psionic Discipline this turn.

**Swift Precognition**  
When you cast a Psion spell from the Abjuration or Divination school with a casting time of an action, you can expend a number of Psionic Energy Dice to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. The number of dice equals one plus the spell's level.

**Tactical Mind**  
When you take the Study action, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the ability check.
