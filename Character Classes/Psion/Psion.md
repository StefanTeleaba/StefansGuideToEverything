## Level 1: Psionic Power
You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice. Your Psion level determines the die size and number of Psionic Energy Dice you have, as shown in the Energy Dice column of the Psion Features table.  
Your Psionic Energy Dice are used to enhance or fuel certain Psion features. You start with two such features: Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection, each of which is detailed below. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Dice, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.  
You regain one expended Psionic Energy Die when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.
Some features that use Psionic Energy Dice require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.  
Telekinetic Propel. As a Bonus Action, choose one Large or smaller creature other than you that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved 5 feet straight toward you or straight away from you. Alternatively, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die when you take this Bonus Action, and the distance moved is equal to 5 times the number rolled. The die is expended only if the target fails the saving throw.  
Telepathic Connection. You have telepathy with a range of 30 feet. As a Bonus Action, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die. For the next hour, the range of your telepathy increases by a number of feet equal to 10 times the number rolled. The first time you use this Bonus Action after each Long Rest, you don’t expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use this feature, you expend the die.

## Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned how to channel magical energy using the power of your mind. See the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Psion spells, which appear in the Psion spell list later in the class’s description.  
***Cantrips.*** You know two Psion cantrips of your choice. Minor Illusion and Telekinetic Fling are recommended.  
Whenever you gain a Psion level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Psion cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Psion levels 4 and 10, you learn another Psion cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Psion Features table.  
***Spell Slots.*** The Psion Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 Psion spells. Charm Person, Command, Dissonant Whispers, and Mage Armor are recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Psion levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Psion Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Psion spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Psion, your list of prepared spells can include six Psion spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.  
If another Psion feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Psion spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Psion level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Psion spell of an eligible level.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Psion spells.  
***Psionic Spellcasting.*** When you cast a Psion spell, that spell doesn’t require a Verbal or Material component, even if the spell includes “V” or “M” in its “Components” entry, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or have a cost specified in the spell.

## Level 1: Subtle Telekinesis
You know the Mage Hand cantrip. You can cast it without Somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand Invisible when you cast it.

## Level 2: Psionic Discipline
You learn further psionic techniques that are fueled by your Psionic Energy Dice. You gain two disciplines of your choice, such as Expanded Awareness and Id Insinuation. Disciplines are described in the “Psionic Discipline Options” section later in this class’s description.  
You can use only one Discipline each turn and only once per turn unless otherwise noted in one of those options.  
Whenever you gain a Psion level, you can replace one of your Psionic Discipline options with one you don’t know. You gain one additional option at Psion levels 5, 10, 13, and 17.

## Level 3: Psionic Subclass

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

## Level 5: Psionic Restoration
You can perform a meditation that focuses the mind for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Psionic Energy Dice. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 7: Psionic Surge
You can push your psionic powers using your life force. After you roll one or more Psionic Energy Dice, you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice and treat any roll of 1, 2, or 3 on those Psionic Energy Dice as a 4.

## Level 18: Psionic Reserves
When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Psionic Energy Dice until you have four if you have fewer than that.

## Level 19: Epic Boon

## Level 20: Enkindled Life Force
You burn your life force to achieve greater psionics. Once per turn, when you roll one or more Psionic Energy Dice for a Psion feature or Psionic Discipline, you can expend one or two of your Hit Point Dice. For each Hit Point Die expended, roll an additional Psionic Energy Die and add the numbers rolled to the total. This roll does not expend the Psionic Energy Die.

### Psionic Discipline Options

**Biofeedback.** When you cast a Psion spell from the Necromancy or Transmutation school, you can expend a number of Psionic Energy Dice up to your Intelligence modifier, roll them, and gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the total number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).

**Bolstering Precognition.** When you cast a Psion spell from the Abjuration or Divination school, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die. Roll the die and choose a creature you can see within 60 feet (which can be yourself). Until the end of your next turn, the creature gains a bonus to the next D20 Test it makes equal to the number rolled.

**Destructive Thoughts.** When you cast a Psion spell from the Conjuration or Evocation school that forces a creature you can see to make a saving throw against the spell, you can expend a number of Psionic Energy Dice up to your Intelligence modifier, and roll them. The creature takes Psychic damage equal to the total number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one), regardless of the result of the saving throw.

**Devilish Tongue.** When you take the Influence action, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the ability check. If this causes you to succeed on the ability check, the die is expended.

**Expanded Awareness.** When you take the Search action, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the ability check. If this causes you to succeed on the ability check, the die is expended.

**Id Insinuation.** When you cast a Psion spell from the Enchantment or Illusion school that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can expend one Psionic Energy Dice and roll it. One target of the spell you can see subtracts half the number rolled (round up) from its saving throw against the spell.

**Innert Aim.** When you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.

**Observant Mind.** When you take the Study action, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the ability check. If this causes you to succeed on the ability check, the die is expended.

**Psionic Backlash.** Immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll it, and reduce the damage you take from the attack equal to two times the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of two). In addition, you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes Psychic damage equal to the amount of damage you reduced.

**Psionic Guards.** At the start of your turn, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die. Until the start of your next turn, you have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions and Advantage on Intelligence saving throws. If you are Charmed or Frightened when you use this discipline, the condition ends on you.  
When you use Psionic Guards, you can also use a different Psionic Discipline this turn.

**Sharpened Mind.** At the start of your turn, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die to hone your destructive psionics. Roll the die and record the number rolled. You gain the following benefits for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition.  
***Bypassing Psionics.*** Damage from your weapon attacks, Psion spells, and Psion features ignores Resistance to Psychic damage.  
***Attack Mode.*** Once per turn, when you deal Psychic damage to one or more creatures, you can replace the number rolled on one of the damage dice with the number recorded when you activated this Psionic Discipline.  
When you use Sharpened Mind, you can also use a different Psionic Discipline this turn.
