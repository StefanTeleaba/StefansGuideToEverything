Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse’s workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead’s rest, is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. These deities teach their followers to respect the dead and pay them due homage. Followers of these deities seek to put restless spirits to rest, destroy the undead wherever they find them, and ease the suffering of dying creatures. Their magic also allows them to stave off a creature’s death, though they refuse to use such magic to extend a creature’s lifespan beyond its mortal limits.

## Level 3: Domain Spells

## Level 3: Circle of Mortality
You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death.  
***Solace.*** When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 Hit Points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.  
***Preservation.*** You learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know and you can take a Bonus Action to cast it. When you cast the spell, you can choose to restore the creature to a number of Hit Points equal to half your Cleric level. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses whenever you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Path to the Grave
You can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination. As a Magic action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has Vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.

## Level 6: Sentinel at Death’s Door
You gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a Reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a Critical Hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a Critical Hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Keeper of Souls
You can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to the creature’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.
