# Grave Domain
*Unearthed Arcana 2025 - Horror Subclasses*  
*This subclass was published on May 6th, 2025.*  

*Embody Deific Forces of Death*
The Grave Domain concerns itself with the boundary between life and death. To those who tap into this domain’s power, death is a foundational, natural, and inevitable part of the multiverse. Such Clerics seek to destroy Undead and strive to shepherd spirits to the afterlife (whether those spirits want to go or not).  
The magic of this domain also allows these Clerics to stave off death for a time, particularly for those who still have some great work to accomplish in the world. But this is merely a delay of death, not a denial of it, for the grave will always claim its due.

## Level 3: Circle of Mortality
You gain the ability to manipulate the balance between life and death, granting you the following benefits.  
***Pull of Death.*** Once per turn, when you cast a spell or hit with an attack roll and deal damage to a Bloodied creature, that creature takes an extra 1d4 Necrotic damage.  
***Return to Life.*** When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature at 0 Hit Points with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d4 Hit Points to a creature at 0 Hit Points with a spell, you restore 8.

## Level 3: Grave Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Grave Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Grave Domain Spells**
| Cleric Level | Spells |
|:------------:|--------|
| 3            | Bane, Chill Touch, Detect Evil and Good, Gentle Repose, Ray of Enfeeblement |
| 5            | Revivify, Vampiric Touch |
| 7            | Blight, Dispel Evil and Good |
| 9            | Hold Monster, Raise Dead |

## Level 3: Path to the Grave
As a Bonus Action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to curse one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself until the start of your next turn. While cursed, the creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.  
When you or an ally you can see hits the cursed target with an attack roll, you can end the curse early (no action required) to make the attack deal extra Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to 1d8 plus your Cleric level.

## Level 6: Sentinel at Death's Door
When you or a Bloodied creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself is hit with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve that attack’s damage.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Divine Reaper
Your deep connection to this domain renders you a hallowed harbinger of death, granting you the following benefits.  
***Enhanced Necromancy.*** When you cast a spell of level 5 or lower from the Necromancy school that targets one creature or a spell from the Grave Domain Spells table, you can expend a use of Channel Divinity to target a second creature within the spell’s range. If the spell requires costly or consumed Material components, you must provide Material components for each target.  
***Keeper of Souls.*** When an enemy dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself regains Hit Points equal to three times your Cleric level. You can’t use this feature if you have the Incapacitated condition. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse’s workings. To resist death, or to desecrate the dead’s rest, is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. These deities teach their followers to respect the dead and pay them due homage. Followers of these deities seek to put restless spirits to rest, destroy the undead wherever they find them, and ease the suffering of dying creatures. Their magic also allows them to stave off a creature’s death, though they refuse to use such magic to extend a creature’s lifespan beyond its mortal limits.

## Level 3: Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Grave Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Circle of Mortality
You gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death.  
***Solace.*** When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 Hit Points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.  
***Preservation.*** You learn the Spare the Dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know and you can take a Bonus Action to cast it. When you cast the spell, you can choose to restore the creature to a number of Hit Points equal to half your Cleric level. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses whenever you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Path to the Grave
You can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature’s life force for termination. As a Magic action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has Vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.

## Level 6: Sentinel at Death’s Door
You gain the ability to impede death’s progress. As a Reaction when you or an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a Critical Hit, you can turn that attack into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a Critical Hit are canceled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Keeper of Souls
You can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to the creature’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.
