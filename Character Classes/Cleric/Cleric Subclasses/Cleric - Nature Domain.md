Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself; from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.

## Level 3: Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Nature Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Acolyte of Nature
You are attuned to the magic of both divine and nature.  
***Nature Magic.*** You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. This cantrip counts as a Cleric cantrip for you, but it doesnâ€™t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can exchange this cantrip for a different Druid cantrip of your choice.  
***Natural Talent.*** You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.

## Level 3: Control Plantlife
You can call on natural plantlife to serve your needs. As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity and select one non-magical, inanimate plant within 30 feet of you, producing one of the following effects of your choice, which lasts for 1 minute, until you use this feature again, or until you have the Incapacitated condition:  
***Difficult Terrain.*** The ground in a 15 foot Emanation around the plant becomes Difficult Terrain.  
***Grasping Limbs.*** Whenever a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the plant for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be Grappled by the plant (escape DC equals your spell save DC). While Grappled, the creature also has the Restrained condition.

## Level 6: Dampen Elements
When you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage, you can use your Reaction to grant Resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.

## Level 17: Master of Nature
You can call on nature to aid you in battle. When you start casting Summon Beast with a spell slot of level 5 or lower, you can alter it for this casting, changing the spell in the following ways:  
***No Concentration.*** The spell does not require you to Concentrate on it. You can dismiss the spell as a Bonus Action.  
***Two Beasts.*** The spell summons two Bestial Spirits instead of one. The two beasts do not need to be of the same type and you can command them independently. If you are Incapacitated, the Beasts take their turns as normal and act to defend you.  
***Elemental Damage.*** When the Beasts hit with an attack, you can change the damage type to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning or Thunder (you choose when they deal damage).  
Once you cast the spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
