# Apocalypse Domain
*Cthulhu by Torchlight v5.5*

*“Some say the world ends in fire. Others, ice. I'm ready for both.” — Endara, Doom's Daughter*

*Few gods embrace the Apocalypse Domain, yet in times of war, disease, or social upheaval, its Clerics appear at the head of grim cults that proclaim the world's imminent demise. Devotes of the Apocalypse Domain are usually apostates and heretics cast from religious orders for their fanatical conviction to the end of all things.*  
*The exact origin of their divine power confounds the elders of established religions. Sometimes, these Clerics derive their powers from the gods of fate, doom, or change. More often, though, they seem to draw their power from the collective gloom of a population facing disaster. Perhaps the world's demise is truly imminent, and these visionaries have found some way to tap into the apocalypse as it grows near.*

**Alignment**  
Consider your alignment and how it dictates your attitude toward the apocalypse. Below are some ideas on how your philosophy shapes your attitudes and religious practices. You can also use this table to determine the nature of your cult.  
| Alignment | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Chaotic | Each of us faces the apocalypse alone. We must find our own path to making peace with the imminent destruction of all we hold dear. In these end times, laws, traditions, and restrictions mean nothing. We are entitled to live as we see fit. |
| Lawful | The apocalypse is at hand, but if you obey the dictates and commandments determined by your order, you have the chance to escape. The gods will preserve those who are worthy, and you will know the worthy by their observance to the proper traditions, rites, and sacrifices. |
| Neutral | All things die, including the world. By cataloging the end times, perhaps we can preserve a sliver of our reality for whatever world arises from the ashes. But make no mistake—when the world ends, we will end with it. |
| Evil | It isn't enough for the apocalypse to come to the world-we must hasten its appearance by culling those foolish enough to defy it. By doing so, the force behind the coming disaster will welcome us as its instruments and preserve us after we end this world. |
| Good | The apocalypse is a cleansing event, one that will see the wickedness of the world washed away in favor of a new order. Our task is to spread knowledge of the righteous path. We must be patient and kind, for few wish to hear our message. But those wise enough to embrace our hymn will join us in the paradise to come. |
