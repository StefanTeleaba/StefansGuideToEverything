# Arcana Domain
*Unearthed Arcana - Arcane Subclasses*  
*This subclass was published on June 26th, 2025.*  

*Blend Conviction with Arcane Power*  
Magic suffuses the multiverse and fuels both destruction and creation. Clerics with this domain view magical knowledge not as power to be used in pursuit of personal ends, but as a gift they have the responsibility to share.  
Gods associated with the Arcana Domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. These gods are often connected to knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand, or to secrecy or power.  

## Level 3: Arcana Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain means you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Arcana Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.  

**Arcana Domain Spells**
| Cleric Level | Spells |
|:------------:|--------|
| 3            | Detect Magic, Magic Missile, Magic Weapon, Nystul’s Magic Aura |
| 5            | Counterspell, Dispel Magic |
| 7            | Arcane Eye, Leomund’s Secret Chest |
| 9            | Bigby’s Hand, Teleportation Circle |

## Level 3: Arcane Initiate
You gain the following benefits.  
***Arcane Knowledge.*** You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don’t have it already. You also gain Expertise in the Arcana skill.  
***Cantrips.*** You learn two Wizard cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Wizard cantrip.  

## Level 3: Modify Magic
You can use your Channel Divinity to alter your spells as you cast them. When you cast a spell, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and change the spell in one of the following ways (no action required).  
***Fortifying Spell.*** One target of the spell gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 2d8 plus your Cleric level.  
***Tenacious Spell.*** When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, choose one target of the spell you can see. Roll 1d6 and apply the number rolled as a penalty to the target’s saving throw.  

## Level 6: Dispelling Recovery
Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature or ends a condition on a creature, you can cast Dispel Magic on the creature as a Bonus Action without expending a spell slot.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  

## Level 17: Arcane Mastery
You learn four Wizard spells, one from each of levels 6, 7, 8, and 9. You thereafter always have those spells prepared. Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of these spells with another Wizard spell of the same level.

Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.  
The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.

## Level 3: Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Arcana Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
