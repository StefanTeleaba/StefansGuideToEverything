Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.  
The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and Wee Jas of Greyhawk.

## Level 3: Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Arcana Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Arcane Initiate
You have proficiency in the Arcana skill and you learn two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list, which count as Cleric cantrips for you.

## Level 3: Collective Knowledge
You can use your Channel Divinity to bestow divine knowledge on yourself and your allies. As a Magic action, you present your holy symbol to emanate a divine source of truth in a 15 foot Emanation for 1 minute. You and all allies that are within the Emanation have Advantage on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws and gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class.

## Level 6: Spell Breaker
When you restore Hit Points to an ally with a spell of level 1 or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

## Level 17: Arcane Mastery
You choose four spells from the Wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of Domain spells. Like your other Domain spells, they are always prepared and count as Cleric spells for you.
