The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to the laws that govern a society, an institution, or a philosophy. Clerics of Order meditate on logic and justice as they serve their gods, examples of which appear in the Order Deities table.  
Clerics of Order believe that well-crafted laws establish legitimate hierarchies, and those selected by law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability, and if those who lead fail to protect the law, they must be replaced. In this manner, law weaves a web of obligations that create order and security in a chaotic multiverse.

## Level 3: Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Order Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Voice of Authority
You can invoke the power of law to embolden an ally to attack. If you cast a spell of level 1 or higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their Reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see. If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

## Level 3: Order’s Demand
You can use your Channel Divinity to exert an intimidating presence over others. As a Magic action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the Charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

## Level 6: Embodiment of the Law
You have become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.  
If you cast a spell of the Enchantment school of level 1 or higher, you can change the spell’s casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting, provided the spell’s casting time is normally an action.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Order’s Wrath
Enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. When you use your Voice of Authority feature to allow an ally to make an attack, you empower that attack with the power of law. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 2d10 Psychic damage.
