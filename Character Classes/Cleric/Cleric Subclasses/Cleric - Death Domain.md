The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the underworld (Hades and Hel).

## Level 3: Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Death Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Reaper
You learn one Necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a Necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 15 feet of each other.

## Level 3: Hands of Death
You can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + your cleric level.

## Level 6: Inescapable Destruction
Your ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by your cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores Resistance to Necrotic damage.

## Level 17: Improved Reaper
When you cast a Necromancy spell that is level 5 or lower that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 15 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them for both targets.
