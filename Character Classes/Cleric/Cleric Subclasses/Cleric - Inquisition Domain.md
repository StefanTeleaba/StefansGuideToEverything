# Inquisition Domain
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Cleanse the Heretics*  
The Inquisition Domain reflects the order of the multiverse and the rejection of tainted magicâ€”so far as certain celestial powers see it. Only the divine casters are pure and fit for use.  
Since arcane magic is strong enough to challenge the gods, divine beings of this domain, such as the Arch Seraph Empyreus, demand magic-using mortals be kept in check. Most zealots root out all arcanists, while some strike fragile truces when complete removal isn't feasible.

## Level 3: Inquisition Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Inquisition Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Inquisition Domain Spells**  
| Cleric Level | Spells                      |

## Level 3: Witch Hunter's Strike
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack or Unarmed Strike, you can deal an extra 1d8 Force damage to the target. If the creature is Concentrating on a spell, you deal an extra 2d8 Force damage instead. At Cleric level 14, the extra Force damage increases to 2d8, or 3d8 if the creature is Concentrating on a spell.  
If a creature fails its saving throw to maintain Concentration as a result of taking damage from this feature, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the extra Force damage dealt.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Spell Shield
As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to bestow a temporary resilience against arcane harm for 10 minutes. Choose a creature you can see (including yourself) within 30 feet of yourself. The chosen creature gains Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Cleric level. While a creature has Temporary Hit Points granted by your Spell Shield, the creature has Advantage on saving throws against spells, and it has Resistance to the damage of spells. If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain when Spell Shield ends, they vanish.

## Level 6: Rebuke Invoker
As a Reaction in response to a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself using a Magic action to cast a spell, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 Force damage, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot the creature expended. Cantrips are considered level 1 spells for this ability. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage instead.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once). You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Supernal Safeguard
Spell Shield can target a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature).
