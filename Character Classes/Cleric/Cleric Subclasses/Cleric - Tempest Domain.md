Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain – including Talos, Umberlee, Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor – govern storms, sea, and, sky. They include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods, and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.

## Level 3: Wrath of the Storm
You can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your Reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity save. The creature takes Lightning or Thunder (your choice) damage equal to 1d8 plus your Cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Destructive Wrath
You can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity. When you roll Lightning or Thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.

## Level 6: Thunderous Strike
When you deal Lightning or Thunder damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

## Level 17: Stormborn
The winds of the tempest lift your form into the air. You have a Fly speed equal to your Speed.
