# Purification Domain
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Purge Sickness with Suffering*  
The Purification Domain believes sickness, mutation, and other forms of bodily corruption are signs of a corresponding spiritual malady. Virtue can't exist alongside impurity. The wickedness of humanity and other mortal, sentient creatures is a contagion that manifests plagues such as the Weeping Pox. When there's a risk of such corruption spreading, there's only one surefire way to contain the rot and atone for the sins that led to this point: Burn it out.

## Level 3: Cleanse with Fire
When you deal damage with a cantrip or an attack with a weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can deal an additional 1d8 Fire damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 3: Purification Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Purification Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Purification Domain Spells**  
| Cleric Level | Spells                                 |
|:------------:|----------------------------------------|
| 3            | Detect Poison and Disease, Flame Blade |
| 5            | Fear, Flash Fever                      |
| 7            | Aura of Purity, Wall of Fire           |
| 9            | Flame Strike, Hold Monster             |

## Level 3: Unclean Brand
When you hit a creature with a melee attack with a weapon or Unarmed Strike, instead of dealing the strike's normal damage, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to sear a symbol into the creature's flesh, marking it with a glowing brand for 1 minute. During that time, the creature has Disadvantage on saving throws against your spells. Additionally, the creature gains Vulnerability to Fire damage you deal, even if it normally has Resistance or Immunity to Fire damage.

## Level 6: Ward Against Corruption
You have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end diseases and against any effect that would change your form, such as the Polymorph spell.  
As a Magic action, you can touch a willing creature to grant this benefit, but the creature takes Fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity. Once you grant this benefit, it lasts for 1 hour or until you grant this benefit again.

## Level 17: Sear Imperfections
You can cast Lesser Restoration and Greater Restoration on a willing creature without expending spell slots and without Material components, but the target takes 1d6 Fire damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
