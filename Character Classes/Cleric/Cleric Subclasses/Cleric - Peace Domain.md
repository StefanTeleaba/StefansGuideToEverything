The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing. See the Peace Deities table for a list of some of the gods associated with this domain.  
Clerics of the Peace Domain preside over the signing of treaties, and they are often asked to arbitrate in disputes. These clerics' blessings draw people together and help them shoulder one another's burdens, and the clerics' magic aids those who are driven to fight for the way of peace.

## Level 3: Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Peace Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Emboldening Bond
As a Magic action, you can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another. You choose 2 willing creatures within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself). You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While a bonded creature is within 30 feet of another bonded creature and fails a D20 Test, it can use its Reaction to roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the result. Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest, unless you expend a spell slot of level 1 or higher to use it again. The number of creatures you can choose for the bond increases by 1 at level 6 (3 creatures) and at level 17 (4 creatures).

## Level 3: Balm of Peace
You can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As a Magic action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking Opportunity Attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of Hit Points to that creature equal to your 2d6 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

## Level 6: Protective Bond
The bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, a bonded creature within 30 feet can use its Reaction to divide the damage equally among all bonded creatures within 30 feet (rounded up) or take all the damage instead. Once the creatures use this effect, they cannot do so again until the start of your next turn.

## Level 17: Expansive Bond
The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else's damage, the creature has Resistance to that damage.
