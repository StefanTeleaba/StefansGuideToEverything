# The Parasite Patron
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Become One with a Cosmic Being*  
Your patron is a cosmic parasite, draining the vitality of entire peoples and worlds. Upon forging a pact with such a patron, you become host to one of its nascent offspring. As you grow in power, the boundary between your identity and the parasitic larva within blurs.

## Level 3: Spell Siphon
Your patron has taught you to siphon magic from your enemies and make it your own. Immediately after a creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, that creature can't cast a spell again until 8 hours have passed. While this effect lasts, if the spell was at least level 1 and of a level you can cast, you have that spell prepared.  
The maximum number of spell levels you can have siphoned at once equals 1 plus your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). If you have the Incapacitated condition or die, you lose all siphoned spells. When you finish a Long Rest, you lose all siphoned spells.

## Level 3: Physical Specimen
Your patron has enhanced your physical form to improve your utility as a host and pawn. As a Bonus Action, once per Long Rest, choose a number of the following benefits up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one) that lasts until you finish a Long Rest. Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can choose one of your selected benefits and replace it with another from this list.
- Your Hit Point maximum increases by an amount equal to your Warlock level.
- You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.
- You Speed increases by 5 feet.
- You have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.
- Your jump distance is tripled, and you gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
- Add your Charisma modifier to your Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

## Level 6: Symbiotic Sentinel
Your patron remains alert to threats to its host at all times. You can't be surprised and you have Advantage on Initiative rolls. You also have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed and Frightened conditions.

## Level 10: Spawn Pawn
You always have the Dominate Person spell prepared. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.  
In addition, taking damage can't break your Concentration on Dominate Person. When a creature succeeds on its saving throw, it takes Psychic damage equal to your Warlock level.

## Level 14: Larval Regeneration
When you die, a larval parasite bursts from your corpse. You control the parasite. The parasite uses the Rat stat block except it has your Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. It can't cast spells. In addition, it has the following ability:  
***Burrowing Possession.*** As a Magic action, the parasite can cause a Humanoid within 5 feet of it to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (your choice) against your Warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the parasite burrows into the creature, dealing Piercing damage equal to your Warlock level. While burrowed inside a creature, the parasite can't take any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction, has Total Cover, and has Immunity to all damage except Psychic damage.  
On each of the creature's subsequent turns, it can use its action to make a Constitution saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC. If the creature succeeds, the parasite is ejected from its body and into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice within 5 feet of it. If the parasite is burrowed inside the creature when the creature's turn ends, the creature takes Necrotic damage equal to twice your Warlock level. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 Hit Points, it immediately dies, the parasite disappears, and you take over the body of the Humanoid as if you had been targeted by the Reincarnate spell and rolled the species the Humanoid had been.  
If you are returned to life, such as by the Revivify spell, your parasite immediately disappears.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
