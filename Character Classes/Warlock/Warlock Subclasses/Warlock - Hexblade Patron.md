You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell – a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.  
Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.

## Level 3: Patron Spells
The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Hexblade Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Hexblade Spells
| Warlock Level | Spells                          |
|:-------------:|---------------------------------|
| 3             | Blur, Shadow Blade, Hex, Shield |
| 5             | Blink, Elemental Weapon         |
| 7             | Phantasmal Killer, Fire Shield  |
| 9             | Hold Monster, Cone of Cold      |

## Level 3: Hex Warrior
You gain Armor Training with Medium Armor and Shields, and you gain the use of the Mastery property of one weapon you have proficiency with of your choice. When you finish a Long Rest, you can choose a different weapon and gain its Mastery property instead.

## Level 3: Hexblade's Curse
You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on your enemies. As a Bonus Action, you can choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition or if you die. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:  
***Improved Critical.*** Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.  
***Maim.*** Once per turn, when you hit the cursed target with an attack, you can deal additional damage equal to 2 plus half of your Warlock level.  
***Reaper.*** If the cursed target dies, you can take a Bonus Action to curse a new creature, or end the curse and regain Hit Points equal to half of your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).  
You can use this feature twice and regain all expended uses when again you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 6: Accursed Specter
You can curse the soul of a creature you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a creature, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as an Accursed Specter, as detailed below. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.  
The Accursed Specter remains in your service until the end of your next Long Rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind an Accursed Specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Armor of Hexes
Your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

## Level 14: Master of Hexes
Your Hexblade’s Curse becomes more debilitating. When you curse a creature with your Hexblade’s Curse, you gain the following benefits:  
***Impending Doom.*** The cursed target has its Speed reduced by 15 feet.  
***Relentless Curse.*** You can take a Bonus Action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the cursed target. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the cursed target.
