*Forge a Pact with a Cursed Blade*  
You’ve made a pact with a sentient magic weapon and the cursed forces contained within its blade. Such a weapon could be the sword sheathed at your side, or it could be a manifestation of an infamous magic weapon like Blackrazor or the Sword of Kas projecting its power to further its legend. To those willing to follow this weapon’s whims, these inscrutable patrons offer the power to bestow malignant curses, deliver punishing blows, and bolster the wielder.

## Level 3: Hexblade Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Hexblade Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Hexblade Spells**
| Warlock Level | Spells |
|:-------------:|--------|
| 3             | Arcane Vigor, Hex, Shield, Wrathful Smite |
| 5             | Bestow Curse, Conjure Barrage |
| 7             | Freedom of Movement, Staggering Smite |
| 9             | Animate Objects, Steel Wind Strike |

## Level 3: Hexblade's Curse
Your patron grants you the power to curse and hinder your foes. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target is cursed for 1 minute, during which you gain the benefits below. The curse ends early if you use this feature again, if you dismiss it (no action required), or die.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. When you cast a spell using a spell slot that curses a target, you can use your Hexblade’s Curse as a part of casting that spell instead of taking a Bonus Action. When you do so, the target of the spell is the target of your Hexblade’s Curse, and your Hexblade’s Curse’s duration is either 1 minute or the spell’s duration, whichever is longer.  

***Hungering Hex.*** When the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse drops to 0 Hit Points, you regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Charisma modifier.  

***Accursed Shield.*** While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC while you are within 10 feet of the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse.  

## Level 3: Unyielding Will
When you succeed on a saving throw to maintain Concentration, each creature of your choice in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you takes 2d6 Necrotic damage. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.  
In addition, when you fail a saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can choose to succeed instead, and you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Warlock level. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  

## Level 6: Malign Brutality
Your patron’s might furthers your bloodthirst, granting you the following benefits.  

***Harrowing Hex.*** After you cast a level 1+ spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.  

***Hindering Curse.*** When you hit the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse with an attack roll, the target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.  

***Inescapable Hex.*** When the target of your Hexblade’s Curse ends its turn 30 feet or further from you, you can move up to your Speed straight toward the target.  

## Level 10: Armor of Hexes
When you take damage from the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to your Warlock level.

## Level 14: Masterful Hex
The power of your Hexblade’s Curse increases, granting the following benefits.  

***Accursed Critical.*** Any attack roll you make against the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse scores a Critical Hit on a roll of a 19 or 20 on the d20.  

***Explosive Hex.*** When you deal damage to the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse, you can cause your curse to explode with sinister energy. The target and each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from the target take 3d6 Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice), and their Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.  

***Hex Restoration.*** You regain one expended use of Hexblade’s Curse when you finish a Short Rest or use your Magical Cunning feature.

***Inevitable Blade.*** Once per turn, if you make an attack roll against the target cursed by your Hex and miss, you can deal Necrotic damage to that creature equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 Necrotic damage).

# Hexblade Patron
*by*  
*PerfectlyCircularSeal*  
*Shades the Mothman*  
*Spaghetti0 Homebrew*  

You have made your pact with a mysterious entity from the Shadowfell – a force that manifests in sentient magic weapons carved from the stuff of shadow. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.  
Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.

## Level 3: Patron Spells
The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Hexblade Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Hexblade Spells
| Warlock Level | Spells                          |
|:-------------:|---------------------------------|
| 3             | Blur, Shadow Blade, Hex, Shield |
| 5             | Blink, Elemental Weapon         |
| 7             | Phantasmal Killer, Fire Shield  |
| 9             | Hold Monster, Cone of Cold      |

## Level 3: Hex Warrior
You gain Armor Training with Medium Armor and Shields, and you gain the use of the Mastery property of one weapon you have proficiency with of your choice. When you finish a Long Rest, you can choose a different weapon and gain its Mastery property instead.

## Level 3: Hexblade's Curse
You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on your enemies. As a Bonus Action, you can choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition or if you die. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:  
***Improved Critical.*** Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.  
***Maim.*** Once per turn, when you hit the cursed target with an attack, you can deal additional damage equal to 2 plus half of your Warlock level.  
***Reaper.*** If the cursed target dies, you can take a Bonus Action to curse a new creature, or end the curse and regain Hit Points equal to half of your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).  
You can use this feature twice and regain all expended uses when again you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 6: Accursed Specter
You can curse the soul of a creature you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a creature, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as an Accursed Specter, as detailed below. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.  
The Accursed Specter remains in your service until the end of your next Long Rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind an Accursed Specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Armor of Hexes
Your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

## Level 14: Master of Hexes
Your Hexblade’s Curse becomes more debilitating. When you curse a creature with your Hexblade’s Curse, you gain the following benefits:  
***Impending Doom.*** The cursed target has its Speed reduced by 15 feet.  
***Relentless Curse.*** You can take a Bonus Action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the cursed target. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the cursed target.
