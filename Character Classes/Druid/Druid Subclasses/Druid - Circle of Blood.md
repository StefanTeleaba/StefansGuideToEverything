# Circle of Blood
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Wreak Bloody Havoc*  
The Circle of Blood is a keeper of the old ways. They remember how ancient Druids performed sacrificial rituals under a blood-red moon to appease the uncaring forces of nature. These Druids trade blood for life in a delicate balance to bolster their allies and destroy their enemies.
