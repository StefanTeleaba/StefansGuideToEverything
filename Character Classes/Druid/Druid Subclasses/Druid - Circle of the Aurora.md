*Channel Arctic Power to Inspire and Beguile*  
In the cold, harsh climates of the arctic and antarctic tundras, druids can be found communing with brilliant and colorful lights which streak the skies - known as auroras. These druids channel the dazzling power of these aurorae to protect their ancestral homes, beguiling would-be invaders with enchanting lights of their own.

## Level 3: Circle Spells
Your connection to this circle ensures that you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of Bark Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.  
In addition, you can cast Dancing Lights without the need to concentrate on it. The spell ends early if you cast it again, or if you choose to end it at any time (no action required).

## Level 3: Enchanting Aurora
When you cast the Dancing Lights spell, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to manifest each light as a multi-colored aurora for the spell’s duration. The spell improves in the following ways:  
***Hopeful Lights.*** While a friendly ceature is within the glow of one of the lights, it is instilled with hope and confidence. It has Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.  
***Mesmerizing Lights.*** As a Bonus Action, or as part of the Bonus Action you use to move the lights, you can attempt to mesmerize creatures that are within the glow of one of the lights (you choose which light) and can see it. Each creature within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature is mesmerised, meaning it cannot willingly move out of the aurora’s light or make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.

## Level 6: Tundral Attunement
You have become suffused with the magic of the tundra, granting you the following benefits:  
***Tundral Resilience.*** You have Resistance to Cold damage, and have Advantage on saving throws to avoid Exhaustion due to exposure to cold weather.  
***Arctic Chill.*** Once per turn when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your Circle Spells, you can shock its system with an arctic chill. The creature takes 1d6 Cold damage and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

## Level 10: Distracting Lights
Your Enchanting Aurora’s appearance becomes even more awe-striking. A creature affected by your Mesmerizing Lights is distracted from their surroundings. The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls are made against it at Advantage.

## Level 14: Empowered Aurora
Your Enchanting Aurora feature improves in the following ways:  
***Hopeful Lights.*** When a friendly creature starts their turn within the glow of one of the lights, it has Advantage on the first attack roll or ability check it makes on that turn.  
***Mesmerizing Lights.*** When you use Mesmerizing Lights you can attempt to mesmerize creatures in the glow of any number of the lights, not just one.
