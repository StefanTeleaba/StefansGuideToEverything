# Circle of Bark
[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)

*Defend Forests with Martial Prowess*  
Druids of the Circle of Bark typically hail from dense forests, nearly untouched by the outside world. Fiercely protective of their homes, these druids train to blend their primal magic with martial prowess, favoring close quarters combat to draw enemies into their spell effects. Legends tell of these warriors wading into battle with skin as thick as bark. In truth, they draw power from ancient trees to transmute matter into bark, both to protect themselves, and to encase any foe foolish enough to intrude on their lands.

## Level 3: Circle Spells
Your connection to this circle ensures that you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of Bark Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

## Level 3: Barkskin Warrior
Your primal connection to trees allows you to take on the form of a primal warrior, constantly producing thick bark. As a Bonus Action, or as a part of the Bonus Action you use to cast Barkskin or Shillelagh, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to enter your Barkskin Warrior form for 10 minutes. It ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you dismiss it as a Bonus Action.  
***Regenerating Bark.*** When you enter the form, and again at the start of each of your turns, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Druid level (round up).  
***Spell Immunity.*** You have immunity to the damage of spells you have cast, and your movement cannot be hindered by them.  
***Restricting Bark.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can encase the target in a brittle layer of bark, reducing its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If you hit the creature multiple times, the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.

## Level 6: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.  
In addition, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

## Level 10: Restraining Bark
Your Restricting Bark grows stronger and more debilitating. Once per turn when you use your Restricting Bark feature, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target has the Restrained condition until the start of your next turn, or until a creature within 5 feet of it uses its action to break it free. On a success, the target’s Speed is still reduced as normal.

## Level 14: Reeling Roots
Resembling the sturdy roots of a tree, you can use a Magic action to cause tendrils to shoot out from your body, drawing your enemies toward you. Choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 creature). Each target must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 plus your Wisdom modifier, is pulled up to 30 feet toward you and has the Restrained condition until the start of your next turn. On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not pulled or Restrained.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
