# Circle of Mutation
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Mutate Into an Apex Predator*  
Druids of the Circle of Mutation believe that nature should be improved in order to compete with the unnatural world. Their order hides in the darkest corners of swamps and forests, conducting experiments to warp the structure of their domain. They go unheard from for months, emerging from the wilds with twisted vines and mutated creatures at their side. These Druids have earned the scorn of other circles, discredited as those who have lost their way. In the eyes of these Druids, those who wish to preserve nature as it is simply fear what change brings.

## Level 3: Circle Forms
You channel the endless possibilities of nature when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the benefits below.  
***Challenge Rating.*** The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (rounded down).  
***Predator's Strike.*** When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a Beast form's attack in Wild Shape, you add +2 to the damage dealt.  
***Unpredictable.*** You can take the Dash, Disengage, or Influence action as a Bonus Action.

## Level 3: Mutate Shape
When you assume a Wild Shape form, or as a Bonus Action while your Wild Shape is active, you can expend a spell slot to gain Mutation Points equal to the slot's level. These Mutation Points last until they are spent, you gain additional Mutation Points, or you leave the form. While you have Mutation Points, you can spend them on your turn (no action required by you) to gain a Mutation from the list below. When you do, your body distends and reconstitutes in a gruesome display.  
Mutations last until you leave the form or you expend a spell slot to gain Mutation Points.s
