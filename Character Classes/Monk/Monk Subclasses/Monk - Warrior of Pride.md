# Warrior of Pride
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Prove Your Superiority*  
Monks who become Warriors of Pride value themselves above all. These monks focus on mastering their form, ego, and their destructive power. They display monastic aesthetics publicly with the intention of gaining the respect and admiration of "lesser beings."  
The prideful traditions of this order include adorning themselves with jewelry, hiding their scars, and commanding respect from those who would oppose them.

## Level 3: Tall Tales
You have gained a knack for telling embellished tales of your past achievements. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.

## Level 3: Bruised Ego
Your ego strengthens you as you fight to prove your value. When you expend a Focus Point, you can also gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). While you are Bloodied, you gain twice that amount instead.

## Level 3: Assertive Attacker
While you are Bloodied, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons.

## Level 6: Irrational Retaliation
Damage dealt to you is damage dealt to your pride, and that is something you simply can't allow. Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you can take a Reaction and expend 1 Focus Point. You have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of your next turn.

## Level 6: Redoubled Efforts
When you score a Critical Hit while you are Bloodied, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra damage dealt by the attack.

## Level 11: Ever Prideful
When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can expend 1 Focus Point to enter a trance. While in this trance, you have the following effects:
- You are Immune to the Unconscious condition.
- You can't speak.
- You can't cast or concentrate on spells.
- You suffer 1 Death Saving Throw failure from damage from a Critical Hit instead of 2.

Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Point, you must expend 1 Focus Point to maintain a trance, and you make Death Saving Throws as normal.

## Level 17: Egotistical
Injuries to your pride enrage you. You are considered Bloodied if your current Hit Points are below your Hit Point maximum.
