# Warrior of the Leaden Crown
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Harness the Will to Resist*  
In contrast to the esoteric ideals of other orders, Warriors of the Leaden Crown have practical aims: the self-governance of all people. These Monks see history as a series of clashes between groups of powerful beings where Humanoids are at best collateral damage and at worst disposable pawns. To break this cycle of dependence and destruction, Warriors of the Leaden Crown master mental abilities to fight against the otherworldly powers of the multiverse and protect Humanoid sovereignty.  
One component of this plan involves training to do battle with powerful planar foes. The other equally important component is ensuring that Humanoid societies are prepared to overthrow those already dominating them. To that end, these Monks seek political positions that place them in or near decision-making roles where they can influence others to fight back against Arch Seraphs, Arch Daemons, and Primordials.

## Level 3: Subtle Hand
Your martial arts are enhanced by a capacity for telekinetic strikes. During your turn, your reach is 5 feet greater with Unarmed Strikes. In addition, when you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can choose to have it deal your choice of Psychic damage or its normal damage type.

## Level 3: Psionic Prowess
Your psychic powers have manifested in the ability to cast certain spells. You know the Mage Hand cantrip. You can cast it without Verbal or Somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand Invisible.  
In addition, you can cast certain spells by expending Focus Points. You can take a Magic action and expend 1 Focus Point to cast Detect Evil and Good or Protection from Evil and Good. You can also take a Magic action and expend 2 Focus Points to cast Hold Person, Levitate, or Shatter. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you can cast them without Material components.

## Level 6: Unsubtle Strike
Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your Unarmed Strike or Monk weapon, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw against your Focus Point save DC. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you.

## Level 11: Psychic Crush
Each time you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, it gains a Pressure Point. A creature loses all Pressure Points if you cause a different creature to gain a Pressure Point or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. As a Bonus Action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to telekinetically crush a creature with 1 or more of your Pressure Points. The creature loses all Pressure Points and must make a Strength saving throw against your Focus Point save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 Force damage per Pressure Point, and it has the Restrained condition until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

## Level 17: Psionic Mastery
After much training, you have mastered the psionic disciplines necessary to defend mortals from planar threats. As a Magic action, you can spend 5 Focus Points to cast Dispel Evil and Good, Hold Monster, Telekinesis, or Wall of Force. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you can cast them without Material components.
