# Warrior of Cosmic Balance
*Cthulhu by Torchlight v5.5*

*“When the cosmos spins out of alignment, my job is to kick it back into place. Literally.” — Sheresa, Acolyte of the Vast*

*Warriors of the Cosmic Balance watch the mystic paths of the world, the dimensional portals and arcane gates. And where eldrtich horrors seek to intrude upon the world, these warriors stand waiting. They are trained to use their inner power to purge even the strongest afflictions, and their merest touch can send the mightiest abominations back to the horrid pits that spawned them.*

## Level 3: Guardian of the Way Technique
You have studied alien creatures and learned to disrupt the foul energies that course through them. Once per turn when you make an Unarmed Strike with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can cause one of the following effects:  
***Anchoring Strike.*** Until the end of your next turn, the target can't teleport or use planar travel, including, entering an extradimensional space or demiplane.  
***Banishing Strike.*** The target teleports up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

## Level 3: Seeker
You always have the Detect Magic and Comprehend Languages spells prepared. With this feature, you can cast one of the spells without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Wisdom.  
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend 1 Focus Point (no action required) to restore your use of it.

## Level 6: Warden of Harmony
When a creature within 60 feet of you attempts to teleport, you can take a Reaction and spend 1 Focus Point to prevent the teleportation.

## Level 11: Cosmic Restoration
As a Bonus Action, you can touch a willing creature (which could be yourself) and choose one of the following options.  
***Dispelling Touch.*** You end all spells of your choice currently affecting the target.  
***Purging Touch.*** You remove one of the following conditions from the target: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Exhaustion (decreases by 1), Frightened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, or Stunned.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending 4 Focus Points (no action required).

## Level 17: Ward the Profane
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 3 Focus Points to cast Banishment targeting that creature. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.
