# Warrior of the Street
*Valda's Spire of Secrets: Player Pack v5.5*

*Strike with Combos and Special Moves*

*"Street fighting" is an urban discipline founded on necessity, whose blindingly fast, unique brand of martial arts has been honed and perfected in back-alley brawls and tournaments alike. Monks who adopt this relatively new technique place comparatively little value on spiritual enlightenment and inner focus; the thrill of split-second timing, rapid combos, and decisive knock-outs drive them to become the best combatants in the world*

## Level 3: Combo
When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus Point to begin a combo. Until the end of the current turn, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls of your Unarmed Strikes. This bonus increases by 2, up to a maximum of +6, for each successive hit on the current turn. This bonus resets to +2 if you take damage or miss with an attack roll.

## Level 3: Iron Fist
Whenever you hit an object with an Unarmed Strike, the hit is a Critical Hit.

## Level 6: Special Moves
You have memorized patterns of discrete movements that allow you to use the following special moves.  
***Energy Blast.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to replace one of your attacks with a blast of energy. One creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking Force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die, or half as much damage on a successful save.  
***Guard Breaker.*** If you make an attack roll with your Unarmed Strike and miss the target, you can expend 1 Focus Point to perform a Guard Breaker. This Unarmed Strike deals damage equal to your Dexterity modifier to the target. This miss doesn't reset your Combo bonus to attack rolls.  
***Uppercut.*** When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus point to make an uppercut. You can push the target up to 5 feet away from you and give the target the Prone condition if it is Large or smaller.

## Level 11: Air Dash
On your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed until the end of your next turn (no action required). You have Advantage on the next melee attack you make before the end of the current turn.

## Level 17: K.O.
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can attempt to knock the target out. The target takes extra Force damage equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. If the target has 100 Hit Points or fewer after you deal damage with the Unarmed Strike, it has the Unconscious condition for 10 minutes.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending 5 Focus Points (no action required).
