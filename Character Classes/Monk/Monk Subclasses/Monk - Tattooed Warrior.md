*This subclass was published on June 26th, 2025.*  

*Enhance Martial Arts with Your Magic Tattoos*  
Drawing from diverse body-marking traditions from across the multiverse, Tattooed Warriors can use arcane power imbued in their magic tattoos. These Monks gain tattoos as they grow in martial prowess and insight. Tattooed Warriors can cause their tattoos to change shape to access a versatile suite of physical and magical effects to overcome foes.  

## Level 3: Magic Tattoos
You gain the magic tattoos described by other features of this subclass. The tattoos appear on your body wherever you wish. Damage or injury doesn’t impair your magic tattoos’ function. A magic tattoo’s depiction can look like a brand, scarification, a birthmark, patterns of scale, or any other cosmetic alteration.  
If a tattoo’s effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. Your spellcasting ability for spells granted by a tattoo is Wisdom.  
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can reshape one of your magic tattoos, changing the option you chose from one list to another option on the same list.
