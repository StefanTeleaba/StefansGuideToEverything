# Plague Doctor
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Plague Your Enemies with Magical Concoctions*  
Blending spellcasting with science, you distill your magic into concoctions that harm or heal. Plague Doctors often wear grotesque masks protecting them from their toxic ingredients. Many fearfully regard the mask as a sign of pestilence, making Plague Doctors a source of both hope and trepidation.

## Level 3: Potion Craft
You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and proficiency with the Herbalism Kit and Alchemist's Supplies.  
Additionally, you have learned to create magical potions.  
***Crafting.*** With 10 minutes of work or when you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can prepare magical potions if you have an Herbalism Kit or Alchemist's Supplies. When you do so, you must expend a level 1+ spell slot for each potion you create and choose a spell from your spellbook that targets only one creature. The chosen spell must be of an equal or lower level than the expended spell slot.  
***Consuming.*** As a Bonus Action, a creature can drink the potion or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of it. When a creature consumes the potion, it becomes the target of the spell as if you had cast it. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature that consumes the potion Concentrates on it.  
Unconsumed potions last until you finish a Long Rest or until you use this feature again.

## Level 3: Good Medicine
When you craft a potion, you can choose to expend a spell slot without choosing a spell to craft a dose of Good Medicine. As a Bonus Action, you can drink the dose or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of yourself. When Good Medicine is consumed, roll a number of d8s equal to the level of the spell slot expended, and the target regains Hit Points equal to the roll's total. If you expended a level 3+ spell slot on this feature, Good Medicine also removes the Poisoned condition.

## Level 6: Bad Medicine
When you craft a potion, you can choose to expend a spell slot without choosing a spell to craft a dose of Bad Medicine. When you create a dose, choose one effect per level of the spell slot expended.  
- The creature has the Poisoned condition.
- The creature's Speed is halved.
- The creature takes an extra 1d4 Necrotic damage the first time it takes damage each turn.
- The creature takes 1d6 Poison damage each time it takes an action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.
- The creature takes Acid damage equal to the level of the spell slot expended at the start of each of its turns.

As a Magic action, you can hurl a dose of Bad Medicine at a point you can see within 30 feet. Creatures within 10 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target suffers one of the chosen effects for 1 minute. On each of its turns, the target can take an action and repeat the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Level 10: Breathe It In
Being persistently exposed to the deadliest ailments known has given you some small measure of resistance. After you take Necrotic or Poison damage, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the damage taken. In addition, you are Immune to the Poisoned condition.

## Level 14: Medicinal Master
When Good Medicine restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains 2d8 additional Hit Points.  
When Bad Medicine deals Acid damage to a creature, that creature takes 2d8 extra Acid damage. Additionally, target creatures have Disadvantage on their saving throw.
