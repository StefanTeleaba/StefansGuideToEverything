As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.

## Level 3: Conjuration Savant
Choose two Conjuration spells from the Wizard spell list, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Conjuration spell from the Wizard spell list to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Benign Transposition
You can use a Magic action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest or you cast a Conjuration spell of level 1 or higher to regain its use.

## Level 6: Flexible Summons
You can use a Magic action to magically change the form of a creature summoned by a Conjuration spell you have cast to a different form that spell can summon, provided the spell only summons a single creature. The creature’s Hit Points do not change, unless the new form’s Hit Point Maximum is lower than the creature’s current Hit Points, in which case they are reduced to meet the new maximum.  
For example, if you are Concentrating on Summon Fey, you could change the Fey Spirit from the Tricksy form to the Fuming form.

## Level 10: Focused Conjuration
While you are Concentrating on a Conjuration spell, your Concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

## Level 14: Durable Summons
Any creature that you summon or create with a Conjuration spell has Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wizard level.
