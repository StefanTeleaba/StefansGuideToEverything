# Conjurer
*Unearthed Arcana - Arcane Subclasses Update*  
*This subclass was published on September 18th, 2025.*  

*Step Across Space and Call Creatures from Thin Air*  
You consider distance and matter to be flexible guidelines rather than physical laws. Conjurers harness the power of magic that moves creatures instantly through space and summons creatures to fight on their behalf.

## Level 3: Benign Transposition
As a Bonus Action, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Medium or smaller creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Conjuration Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Conjuration school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Conjuration school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Level 6: Distant Transposition
The range of your Benign Transposition feature increases to 60 feet. Additionally, you now regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 6: Durable Summons
When you cast a Conjuration spell to summon or create a creature using a spell slot, that creature gains Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wizard level when it first appears. While it has these Temporary Hit Points, the creature has Resistance to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant.

## Level 10: Focused Conjuration
Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on Conjuration spells.

## Level 14: Splintered Summons
When you cast Summon Aberration, Summon Construct, Summon Dragon, Summon Elemental, or Summon Fey using a spell slot, you can modify the spell to summon two creatures with the spell instead of one. Each creature is of the same kind, uses the stat block and rules denoted by the spell, and manifests in a different unoccupied space of your choice within the spell’s range, but the summoned creatures’ Hit Points are halved. If you lose Concentration on the spell, both creatures disappear.  
Once you use this feature to modify a spell in this way, you must finish a Long Rest before you do so again. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5+ spell slot (no action required).

As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.

## Level 3: Conjuration Savant
Choose two Conjuration spells from the Wizard spell list, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Conjuration spell from the Wizard spell list to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Benign Transposition
You can use a Magic action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping places. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest or you cast a Conjuration spell of level 1 or higher to regain its use.

## Level 6: Flexible Summons
You can use a Magic action to magically change the form of a creature summoned by a Conjuration spell you have cast to a different form that spell can summon, provided the spell only summons a single creature. The creature’s Hit Points do not change, unless the new form’s Hit Point Maximum is lower than the creature’s current Hit Points, in which case they are reduced to meet the new maximum.  
For example, if you are Concentrating on Summon Fey, you could change the Fey Spirit from the Tricksy form to the Fuming form.

## Level 10: Focused Conjuration
While you are Concentrating on a Conjuration spell, your Concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

## Level 14: Durable Summons
Any creature that you summon or create with a Conjuration spell has Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wizard level.
