*Unearthed Arcana - Arcane Subclasses Update*

*Transform Energy and Matter*  
You study spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith at reality’s forge.  
Some Transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power make and destroy worlds.

## Level 3: Transmutation Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Transmutation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Transmutation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Level 3: Transmuter's Stone
When you finish a Long Rest, you can create a magic stone that lasts until you use this feature again. The stone is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. A creature with the stone in its possession gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws and one of the following benefits, which you choose when you create the stone. You can change the stone’s benefit when you cast a Transmutation spell using a spell slot.  
***Darkvision.*** The bearer gains Darkvision with a range of 60 feet or increases the range of its Darkvision by 60 feet.  
***Speed.*** The bearer’s Speed increases by 10 feet.  
***Resistance.*** The bearer gains Resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder damage (your choice each time you choose this benefit).

## Level 3: Wondrous Alteration
You always have the Alter Self spell prepared and can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a Long Rest.  
While under the effects of Alter Self, you gain an additional benefit for each of its options.  
***Aquatic Adaptation.*** While underwater, you can take the Dash action as a Bonus Action.  
***Change Appearance.*** You have Advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks.  
***Natural Weapons.*** The damage of your new growth increases to 2d6 damage of the type associated with the growth. You also have Advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain Concentration.

## Level 6: Empowered Transmutation
When you cast a Transmutation spell that doesn’t deal damage, such as Fly or Magical Weapon, using a spell slot, you can treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 10: Potent Stone
Your Transmuter’s Stone is more versatile. When you create your Transmuter’s Stone, you can choose up to two benefits. You can choose each option other than Resistance only once. If you choose Resistance twice, you must choose different damage types. You can change either or both benefits when you cast a Transmutation spell using a spell slot.  
In addition, the following are now among your benefit options for Transmuter’s Stone.  
***Mighty Build.*** The bearer has Advantage on Strength saving throws. The bearer also counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity.  
***Tremorsense.*** The bearer gains Tremorsense with a range of 30 feet.

## Level 10: Shapechanger
You always have the Polymorph spell prepared and can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a Long Rest.  
In addition, when you target yourself with the spell, you can modify the spell to gain the benefits below. Once you modify the spell using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
***Game Statistics.*** You retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak. You also retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats.  
***Transmute Spells.*** You can cast Transmutation spells while shape-shifted, except for any spell with a Material component that has a cost specified or is consumed by the spell.

## Level 14: Master Transmuter
While you carry your Transmuter’s Stone, you can take a Magic action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored inside and choose one of the following benefits. After you use your Transmuter’s Stone in this way, the stone crumbles to dust. You can prevent the stone from crumbling by expending a level 5+ spell slot as part of the Magic action you take using this feature.  
***Major Transformation.*** You can transmute one nonmagical object—no larger than a 10-foot Cube or eight connected 5-foot Cubes—into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.  
***Panacea.*** You touch a creature as part of this Magic action, and the target regains a number of Hit Points equal to half its Hit Point maximum (round down). The target is cured of all magical contagions, and any curses affecting the target are lifted, including the target’s Attunement to a cursed item. If the target has the Poisoned or Petrified conditions, those conditions end.  
***Restore Life.*** You cast the Raise Dead spell without expending a spell slot, using the stone in place of the required Material components.  
***Restore Youth.*** You touch one willing creature as part of this Magic action, and the target’s Exhaustion level, if any, decreases to 0 and it permanently appears 3d10 years younger, to a minimum of young adulthood.

# Transmuter
*by*  
*PerfectlyCircularSeal*  
*Shades the Mothman*  
*Spaghetti0 Homebrew*  

You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.  
Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.

## Level 3: Transmutation Savant
Choose two Transmutation spells from the Wizard spell list, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Transmutation spell from the Wizard spell list to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Minor Transmutation 
As a Magic action, you can temporarily alter the physical properties nearby creatures, objects or surfaces, creating one of the following effects:  
***Difficult Terrain.*** Select a point you can see on the ground within 60 feet of you. The area in a 15 foot radius around that point becomes Difficult Terrain for 1 minute if it was normal terrain, or vice versa.  
***Minor Alchemy.*** One object you touch composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, is transformed into a different one of those materials for 1 hour. If the object is too large to be held in the palm of your hand, this process takes an additional 10 minutes for each cubic foot of material.  
***Change Appearance.*** A willing creature you touch gains the ‘Change Appearance’ benefit of the Alter Self spell, without the need to Concentrate. You choose the target’s new appearance, and the target cannot change their appearance in the way the spell describes.  
Only one of these effects can be active at a time, the previous effect instantly ending if you use it again, or if you take a Bonus Action to end it. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Transmuter’s Stone
You can spend 8 hours (which can be over the course of a Long Rest) creating a special stone that stores transmutation magic, called a Transmuter’s Stone. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:  
***Darkvision.*** Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.  
***Swift Movement.*** An increase to Speed of 10 feet.  
***Fortitude.*** Proficiency in Constitution saving throws.  
***Energy Resistance.*** Resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit).  
Each time you cast a Transmutation spell of level 1 or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person. 
If you create a new Transmuter’s Stone, the previous one ceases to function.

## Level 10: Shifting Forms
While you are Concentrating on a Transmutation spell, you can take a Magic action to change the nature of the spell’s transmutation to another that the spell offers. The change has the following effects and conditions:  
***Eligible Spells.*** The spell must be a Transmutation spell of level 1 or higher, and it must affect one or more creatures or objects, and not target an area. The spell must involve some element of choice in how its effects manifest.  
***Same Targets.*** The targets of the spell must not change as a result of making this change.  
***Hit Points.*** If the change would cause a creature’s Hit Points or Temporary Hit Points to change, they change to match that of the new form, unless the new form’s Hit Points or Temporary Hit Points are higher.  
***Self Transmogrification.*** If you are the target of the spell, you can take this action even if your form would otherwise prevent you from doing so.  
For example, if you were Concentrating on Polymorph, you could use this action to change the target’s form from a Giant Eagle to a Riding Horse, or if you were Concentrating on Alter Self, you could change from having a Natural Weapon to an Aquatic Adaptation.

## Level 14: Master Transmuter
As a Magic action, you can consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter’s stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your Transmuter’s Stone is destroyed in the process.  
***Major Transformation.*** You can transmute one non-magical object—no larger than a 5-foot Cube—into another non-magical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.  
***Panacea.*** You remove all curses, diseases and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the Transmuter’s Stone. You can also end the effects of a single spell affecting the creature of your choice. The creature also regains all its Hit Points.  
***Restore Life.*** You cast the Raise Dead spell on the corpse of a creature you touch with the Transmuter’s Stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook. The creature instantly regains all its Hit Points.  
***Restore Youth.*** You touch the Transmuter’s Stone to a willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan.
