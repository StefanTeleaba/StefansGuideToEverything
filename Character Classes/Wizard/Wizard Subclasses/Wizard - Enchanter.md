As an Enchanter, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some Enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most Enchanters fall somewhere in between.

## Level 3: Enchantment Savant
Choose two Enchantment spells from the Wizard spell list, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Enchantment spell from the Wizard spell list to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Hypnotic Gaze
Your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature. As a Magic action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have the Charmed condition until the end of your next turn. While Charmed in this way, the creature has the Incapacitated condition, its Speed drops to 0, and it is visibly dazed.  
On subsequent turns, you can take a Magic action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.  
Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Instinctive Charm
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your Reaction to divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack’s range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target a different creature of your choice within the attack’s range, not including you or itself. On a successful save, you can’t use this feature on the attacker again until you finish a Long Rest.  
You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Creatures that are Immune to the Charmed condition are immune to this effect.

## Level 10: Split Enchantment
When you cast an enchantment spell of level 1 or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

## Level 14: Alter Memories
You gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast an Enchantment spell on one or more creatures, you can alter one creature’s understanding so that it remains unaware of being affected.  
In addition, once before the spell expires, you can use a Magic action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent affected by the spell. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your Enchantment spell.
