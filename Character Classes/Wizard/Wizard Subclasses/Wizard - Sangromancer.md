# Sangromancer
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Spill Blood for Power*  
You study an uncommon school of magic known as Sangromancy or blood magic. Despite its dark reputation, there's nothing inherently evil about the practice of Sangromancy, though its demands on its practitioners are gruesome. As a Sangromancer, your chosen magic demands more than knowledge: it demands sacrifice. Other Wizards may view you with skepticism or even outright hostility, but none can deny the potency of your art.

## Level 3: Sangromancy Savant
Sangromancy spells count as Wizard spells for you. Choose two Sangromancy spells, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Sangromancy spell to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Level 3: Full Blooded
You draw magic from blood. It is represented by your Sangromancy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. You have a pool of d12s that you can expend instead of a Hit Die when you cast Sangromancy spells. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 plus your Wizard level. You regain one expended Sangromancy Die when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended Sangromancy Dice when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 6: Sanguine Vigor
Your Hit Point maximum increases by 6, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Wizard level. In addition, whenever you cast a Sangromancy spell with a spell slot, you regain Hit Points equal to the level of the spell slot.

## Level 10: Blood for Blood
Once on each of your turns when you deal damage to one or more creatures with a Wizard spell you cast, you can spend a Hit Point Die or a Sangromancy Die, roll the die, and deal extra damage to one of those creatures equal to the roll. If the creature is Bloodied, you can roll twice and use the higher of the two rolls.

## Level 14: Red Renewal
When you finish a Short Rest, you regain expended Hit Point Dice and Sangromancy Dice equal to half your Wizard level.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
