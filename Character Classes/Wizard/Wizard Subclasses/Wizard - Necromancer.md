The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.  
Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

## Level 3: Necromancy Savant
Choose two Necromancy spells from the Wizard spell list, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Necromancy spell from the Wizard spell list to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Grim Harvest
You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of level 1 or higher, you gain Temporary Hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You also gain this benefit if a creature you summoned or created with a Necromancy spell kills a creature, but only if you are within 60 feet of the creature when it dies.  
You don't gain this benefit for killing Constructs or Undead.

## Level 6: Undead Thrall
You add the Animate Dead spell to your spellbook for free, if it isn’t already there, and you always have it prepared.  
When you cast Animate Dead or another Necromancy spell that summons or creates an Undead creature, you can enhance one of the summoned/created creatures in the following ways:  
***Vigor.*** The creature’s Hit Point Maximum increases by an amount equal to your Wizard level.  
***Wrath.*** The creature uses your spell attack modifier for its attacks, if it wasn’t already higher, and once per turn when it hits, it adds your Intelligence modifier to its damage roll (minimum +1 damage).  
***Thrall Sight.*** You can see through the thrall’s eyes (or sockets, as appropriate) and hear what it hears.  
***Thrall Spells.*** When you cast a Wizard spell, you can do so as if you were in the Thrall’s space, using its senses. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
Once you grant a creature these benefits, you cannot do so again until that creature dies or otherwise disanimates.

## Level 10: Inured to Undeath
You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.  
***Fearless.*** You are immune to the Frightened condition.  
***Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.  
***Secured Vitality.*** Your Hit Point maximum can’t be reduced by another creature.

## Level 14: Command Undead
You can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As a Magic action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.  
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has Advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
