# Necromancer
*Unearthed Arcana - Arcane Subclasses*  
*This subclass was published on June 26th, 2025.*  

*Command the Powers of Death and Undeath*  
You explore the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As a Necromancer, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all creatures. As you progress, you learn to use magic to drain the life force from a creature, transforming its vital energy into magical power. Many see Necromancers as menacing or villainous, though not all Necromancers are evil. Nevertheless, the manipulation of life and death is considered taboo in many societies.

## Level 3: Necromancy Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Necromancy school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Necromancy school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Level 3: Necromancy Spellbook
Secrets of necromancy magic in your spellbook grant you additional powers. You gain the following benefits.  
***Necrotic Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.  
***Grim Harvest.*** When you cast a Necromancy spell using a spell slot, choose yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the level of the spell slot plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 Temporary Hit Point).

## Level 6: Grave Power
You have discovered more necromantic insights and inscribed them into your spellbook. While holding your spellbook, you gain the following benefits.  
***Grave Resilience.*** When you use Arcane Recovery, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.  
***Overwhelming Necrosis.*** Damage from your Wizard spells and Wizard features ignores Resistance to Necrotic damage.

## Level 6: Undead Thralls
You always have Summon Undead prepared and can cast it once without expending a spell slot.  
When you cast Summon Undead without a spell slot, you can regain Hit Points equal to half the summoned creature’s total Hit Points, but doing so halves the creature’s Hit Points. Once you cast the spell without a spell slot, you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast the spell in this way again.

## Level 10: Undead Secrets
You have learned more secrets about the nuances of life and death. When you finish a Long Rest, you can expend a level 4+ spell slot to protect yourself from death. Until you finish a Long Rest, the next time you would drop to 0 Hit Points, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to ten times the spell slot expended.  
In addition, immediately after you take damage and are Bloodied after taking that damage but not killed outright, you can take a Reaction and teleport to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet from yourself, and each creature within 10 feet of the space you left takes 2d10 Necrotic damage.

## Level 14: Death's Master
Abstruse rituals within your spellbook allow you mastery over forces of death. While holding your spellbook, you gain the following benefits.  
***Bolster Undead.*** As a Bonus Action, choose any number of Undead you have created or summoned with a Necromancy spell that are within 60 feet of yourself. Those Undead each gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Wizard level. Once an Undead gains Temporary Hit Points from this feature, it can’t gain them in this way again for the next 24 hours.  
***Harvest Power.*** When you use Grim Harvest, the creature that gains Temporary Hit Points gains one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until the end of the target’s next turn:
- The target has Advantage on attack rolls.
- The target has Advantage on the next saving throw it makes.

The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.  
Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

## Level 3: Necromancy Savant
Choose two Necromancy spells from the Wizard spell list, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Necromancy spell from the Wizard spell list to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Grim Harvest
You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a spell of level 1 or higher, you gain Temporary Hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School of Necromancy. You also gain this benefit if a creature you summoned or created with a Necromancy spell kills a creature, but only if you are within 60 feet of the creature when it dies.  
You don't gain this benefit for killing Constructs or Undead.

## Level 6: Undead Thrall
You add the Animate Dead spell to your spellbook for free, if it isn’t already there, and you always have it prepared.  
When you cast Animate Dead or another Necromancy spell that summons or creates an Undead creature, you can enhance one of the summoned/created creatures in the following ways:  
***Vigor.*** The creature’s Hit Point Maximum increases by an amount equal to your Wizard level.  
***Wrath.*** The creature uses your spell attack modifier for its attacks, if it wasn’t already higher, and once per turn when it hits, it adds your Intelligence modifier to its damage roll (minimum +1 damage).  
***Thrall Sight.*** You can see through the thrall’s eyes (or sockets, as appropriate) and hear what it hears.  
***Thrall Spells.*** When you cast a Wizard spell, you can do so as if you were in the Thrall’s space, using its senses. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
Once you grant a creature these benefits, you cannot do so again until that creature dies or otherwise disanimates.

## Level 10: Inured to Undeath
You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.  
***Fearless.*** You are immune to the Frightened condition.  
***Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Necrotic damage.  
***Secured Vitality.*** Your Hit Point maximum can’t be reduced by another creature.

## Level 14: Command Undead
You can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As a Magic action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.  
Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has Advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
