# Sanguine Thief
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Eliminate Your Prey with Blood Magic*  
In dark alleyways across Etharis, deals are made in coin and blood, but a few enterprising Rogues have posed the question: "Why not both?" Sanguine Thieves are assassins who harness the power of Sangromancy to fuel their abilities, finding new and innovative ways to utilize the blood they see all too frequently in their line of work.  
Sanguine Thieves learn to draw upon the vitae of their victims, extending their ability to use blood magic beyond the limits of their own vitality. When cornered, Sanguine Thieves can unleash this power in a hail of crimson darts or fade before a foe's blade, leaving nothing behind but a red mist.

## Level 3: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast Wizard spells, as well as spells from the Sangromancy school. All Sangromancy spells and cantrips are treated as Wizard spells for the purposes of this subclass.  
***Cantrips.*** You know three cantrips from the Wizard spell list and from the list of Sangromancy spells. Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.  
***Spell Slots.*** The Sanguine Thief Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sanguine Thief Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sanguine Thief Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  
***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.  
***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

## Level 3: Stolen Power
You draw magic from blood. It is represented by your Sangromancy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. You have a pool of d8s that you can use on Sanguine Thief features. The number of damage dice in the pool equals the number of damage dice as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table. You can't have more Sangromancy Dice than the number of damage dice shown in the Sneak Attack column for your level, unless you have Sangromancy Dice from a different source.  
***Blood Magic.*** You can spend Sangromancy Dice instead of Hit Dice when you cast Sangromancy spells.  
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Steal Blood
When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can restore 1 Sangromancy Die.  
If you are Bloodied, instead of restoring 1 Sangromancy Die when you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can immediately roll the die and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll's total.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 9: Bloody Blades
When you finish a Long Rest, you can spend up to 2 Hit Dice or Sangromancy Dice to create a number of Daggers equal to the number of dice spent in this way. Each Dagger counts as an Arcane Focus for your Sanguine Thief spells, and you can cast spells with Somatic components even if you wield these weapons in one or both hands.  
Additionally, when you score a Critical Hit with this weapon, you can cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target. The extra damage is a number of d8s equal to the number of Hit Dice or Sangromancy Dice spent on this feature. The extra damage is Necrotic.  
The Daggers lasts until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 13: Bloodstitch
As a Magic action, you can spend 3 Hit Dice or Sangromancy Dice to fling a wave of needle-like blood shards. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. You regain 1 Hit Die or Sangromancy Die (your choice) for each creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this feature.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 17: Bloody Exit
When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction and spend 5 Hit Dice or Sangromancy Dice to turn into bloody mist. The attack automatically misses you, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, and you regain your normal form. As part of this Reaction, you can make an attack with a Melee weapon immediately after you teleport. On a hit, this attack deals an extra 5d8 Necrotic damage to the target.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
