# Shadow Stalker
*Cthulhu by Torchlight v5.5*

*“Some folk keep to the shadows. I bring them with me wherever I go.” — Kulden*

*Rogues are at home in the shadows, slipping into the darkness to evade their enemies, strike down unsuspecting foes, or carry off great treasures. Some Rogues feel a strange presence when they slip into the darkness, whispers at the edge of their hearing.*  
*These Rogues hear the call of the shadow, and they are fated to become bound. The darkness can sense a void in a creature's heart, a yearning that can never be filled. Or perhaps it can. The shadows reach out with a simple offer: yield something of your past and open a path to a future where your empty heart is filled. Those who hear this offer are doomed to accept it, and they are doomed to regret it. Yet, the shadow chooses its partners carefully, knowing that those marked for its bargain can't resist.*

## Level 3: Shadowy Reflection
As a Magic action, you expel your shadow from your side and command its actions. It appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and is your size. The Shadowy Reflection can manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an unattended item, or pour out a vial. As a Magic action on your later turns or as part of the Bonus Action when you use your Cunning Action feature, you can control your shadow again. You can move your shadow up to your Speed. The shadow can't attack, active magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds. Your shadow disappears when it takes any damage, is the target of any effect, or if you have the Incapacitated condition.

## Level 3: Shadow Motes
You have the power to control shadows, which is represented by your Shadow Motes. You can expend these motes to enhance or fuel certain Shadow Stalker features. You have an amount of motes equal to your Rogue level. You start knowing three such features: Shadow Scout, Shadow Swap, and Vexing Shadow, each of which is detailed below. When you expend a Shadow Mote, it is unavailable until you finish a Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended motes. You also regain 1 expended Shadow Mote when you reduce a Hostile creature to 0 Hit Points.  
***Shadow Scout.*** As a Magic action, you can expend 1 Shadow Mote to project your senses through your Shadowy Reflection. For 1 minute, you can see and hear through it as if you were located where it is, and you can move it up to 120 feet away from you. This effect ends early if you take any damage or if you have the Incapacitated condition.  
***Shadow Swap.*** When you use your Cunning Action feature, as part of that Bonus Action, you can expend 1 Shadow Mote to swap places with your Shadowy Reflection. You teleport to its space, and it teleports to your space. If you appear in an occupied space, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take Force damage equal to the number of feet you are moved.  
***Vexing Shadow.*** Immediately after you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon and your Shadowy Reflection is within 5 feet of that creature, you can expend 1 Shadow Mote to gain the Invisible condition against that creature until the end of your next turn.

## Level 9: Shadow Succor
You can weave shadows to intercept an attack and direct it harmlessly into a void of darkness. When you use your Uncanny Dodge feature, you can reduce the attack's damage against you to 0.  
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 13: Shadow Gate
Your Shadowy Reflection can create an umbral pathway that you and your companions can use. As a Bonus Action while your Shadowy Reflection is within 5 feet of you, you can expend 4 Shadow Motes to cast Dimension Door. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. Your Shadowy Reflection can travel through the spell.

## Level 17: True Shadow
Your Shadowy Reflection gains the ability to become a deadly clone of you. As a Bonus Action, your Shadowy Reflection transforms into an exact duplicate of you.  
For 1 hour, your Shadowy Reflection becomes substantial, and you can have it take the Attack, Hide, or Utilize action by controlling it with your Shadowy Reflection feature. Its Attack action uses your game statistics, including class features, feats, and weapons. It vanishes when reduced to 0 Hit Points.  
When you make an attack roll against a creature within 5 feet of the duplicate, the attack roll has Advantage.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
