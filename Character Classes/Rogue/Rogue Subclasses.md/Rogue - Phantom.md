*Embrace Death and Wield Ghostly Power*
Some Rogues walk along the veil between life and death, shepherding opponents to the grave and slipping through the world as undetectable as a spirit. In these pursuits, a Rogue might discover a mystical connection to death itself. Such an individual becomes immersed in negative energy, infusing their strikes with deathly energy and stealing knowledge from souls who have passed on. Thieves’ guilds value Rogues of this persuasion as highly effective information gatherers and spies.

## Level 3: Wails from the Grave
Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes Necrotic damage equal to the roll’s total as wails of the dead momentarily sound around them.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Whispers of the Dead
Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can choose one skill or tool proficiency that you lack and gain it, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you use this benefit again to choose a different proficiency.

## Level 9: Tokens of the Departed
The spirits of the dead are drawn to you, and echoes of their past lives magically manifest as strange curios with resonant power.  
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you gain two soul trinkets; each soul trinket is a Tiny object (the DM determines the trinket’s form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the Player’s Handbook to generate it). These trinkets last until you finish another Long Rest, at which point they disintegrate. If you ever move more than 30 feet from a trinket, the trinket immediately teleports to you, appearing somewhere on your person.  
The number of soul trinkets you gain when you finish a Long Rest increases when you reach Rogue levels 13 (three trinkets) and 17 (four trinkets).  
***Using Soul Trinkets.*** You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:  
**Death’s Knell.** When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can expend one soul trinket and immediately use Wails from the Grave without expending a use of that feature. The expended trinket is destroyed.  
**Life Essence.** While you have at least one soul trinket, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws and Constitution saving throws.  
**Spirit Query.** You can take a Magic action to expend one soul trinket and immediately cast the Augury spell, requiring no spell components and using Dexterity as the spellcasting modifier. The expended trinket is destroyed.  
***Regaining Soul Trinkets.*** When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you dies, you can take a Reaction to regain one expended soul trinket.

## Level 9: Voice of Death
You can cast Speak with Dead once without a spell slot, requiring no spell components and using Dexterity as the spellcasting modifier. You regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 13: Ghost Walk
As a Bonus Action, you assume a spectral form, gaining the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend and destroy one of
your soul trinkets from Tokens of the Departed (no action required) to restore your use of it.  
***Flight.*** You gain a Fly Speed of 10 feet and can hover.  
***Hazy Form.*** Attack rolls have Disadvantage against you.  
***Incorporeal Movement.*** You can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you take 1d10 Force damage.

## Level 17: Death's Friend
Your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits.  
***Death’s Lament.*** When you use your Wails from the Grave feature, you can deal the Necrotic damage to both the first and the second creature.  
***Draw of Death.*** When you roll Initiative, you regain one soul trinket for your Tokens of the Departed if you have none remaining.

Many rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues discover a mystical connection to death itself. These rogues take knowledge from the dead and become immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers and spies.  
Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters of these macabre techniques, and some are willing to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgotten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can become a wizard's confidant and right hand. In temples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as an agent to track down those who try to cheat death and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be lost to the grave.  
How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?

## Level 3 - Whispers of the Dead
Echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you use this feature again.

## Level 3 - Wails from the Grave
As you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can channel the power of death to harm someone else as well. Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (rounded up). The second creature takes Necrotic damage equal to the result, as wails of the dead sound around them for a moment.  
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a Short Rest or a Long Rest.

## Level 3 - Tokens of the Departed
When a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that takes physical form: as a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a Soul Trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to generate it.  
You can have a maximum of 2 Soul Trinkets at a time, and you can't create one while at your maximum. The maximum number of trinkets you can have increases to 3 when you reach level 9, to 4 when you reach level 13, and to 5 when you reach level 17.  
You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:  
***Wailing Soul.*** When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn and you have already used your Wails from the Grave feature, you can destroy one soul trinket that is on your person to use it again.  
***Speak with Spirit.*** As an action, you can destroy one of your Soul Trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, as determined by the DM.

## Level 9 - Spirit of Protection
Your vitality is enhanced by your connection to the dead, enhancing your being in the following ways:  
***Ghostly Vitality.*** While a Soul Trinket is on your person, you have Advantage on Death Saves and Constitution saving throws.  
***Minor Exorcism.*** You can use your action to target an ally you can see within 30 feet of you and destroy a Soul Trinket that is on your person to end one effect on that creature causing it to have the Charmed or Frightened condition, or an effect causing it to be possessed.  
***Screams of the Dead.*** When you use your Wails from the Grave feature, you can target 2 additional creatures instead of 1 to deal Necrotic damage to.

## Level 13 - Ghost Walk
You can phase partially into the realm of the dead, becoming like a ghost. As a Bonus Action, you assume a spectral form. While in this form, you have a Fly Speed of 10 feet, you can hover, and attacks have Disadvantage against you. You can also move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 Force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.  
You stay in this form for 10 minutes or until you end it as a Bonus Action. To use this feature again, you must finish a Long Rest or destroy one of your Soul Trinkets as part of the Bonus Action you use to activate Ghost Walk.

## Level 17 - Death's Friend
Your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits:  
***Shrieks of the Dead.*** When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can now target 3 creatures instead of 2, and one of these creatures can be the original target of the Sneak Attack.  
***Call Upon the Fallen.*** At the end of a Long Rest, a Soul Trinket appears in your hand if you are missing any of your Soul Trinkets, as the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.
