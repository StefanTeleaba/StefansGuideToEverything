*v1.1*  

*Infuse Weapon Strikes with Elemental Power*  
Elemental Arbiters harness the power of water, earth, fire and air using magical devices to aid in their unsavory behaviors. Especially skilled as combatants, scuffles with these rogues are a sight to behold, with a myriad of mixed elemental effects assailing their foes.

## Level 3: Elemental Artifact
You have found or created an artifact capable of storing elemental energy. The artifact is a Tiny object with an appearance of your choice that can fit within one hand. The artifact has the following properties:  
***Known Elements.*** Select two elements from Air, Earth, Fire and Water. These are your known elements. You can change your selections when you finish a Long Rest. Starting at level 9 you can select three options, and at level 13 you gain all four.  
***Energy Infusion.*** When you use Sneak Attack while the artifact is on your person, you can change its damage type to match one of your Known Elements: Air (Thunder), Earth (Bludgeoning), Fire or Cold (Water).  
***Elemental DC.*** Effects produced by the artifact use your Elemental DC, which is equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus and your Dexterity modifier.  
***Restoring the Artifact.*** If you lose the artifact or if it is destroyed, you can gain a new one by communing with the elements over the course of a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Empowerment of the Elements
While your Elemental Artifact is on your person, you can use it to enhance your other features with elemental effects, depending on your Known Elements:  
***Air.*** When you take the Dash action, you can boost your movement with a tailwind of rushing air. You can move an extra 10 feet before the end of your turn, and once on your turn when you jump, the distance you can clear increases by 10 feet.  
***Earth.*** When you use your Steady Aim feature you can draw earth to your body, keeping you steady and protecting you. You gain Temporary Hit Points equal to half your Rogue level (rounded up), which last until the start of your next turn. While you have these Temporary Hit Points, you cannot be moved against your will or be inflicted with the Prone condition.  
***Fire.*** When you take the Disengage action, you create an instantaneous burst of flame as you move. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Elemental DC or take Fire damage equal to half your Rogue level (round up).  
***Water.*** When you take the Hide action, you can release moisture in the air to create a misty cloud. The cloud appears in a 10 foot Emanation around you, its area is Lightly Obscured and you can Hide within it. It remains in place until the end of your next turn, and it disperses early if it is subjected to a strong wind.

## Level 9: Elemental Strikes
When you use Energy Infusion to change your Sneak Attack’s damage type, you gain access to an additional Cunning Strike option, depending on your choice of damage type:  
***Bludgeoning (Cost: 2d6).*** The ground in a 10 foot radius around the target becomes Difficult Terrain for 1 minute or until you use this option again. The target must be standing on or otherwise be supported by the ground when you use this option.  
***Cold (Cost: 2d6).*** The target makes a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it has the Restrained condition until the start of your next turn.  
***Fire (Cost: 1d6).*** The target makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, you cause the target to catch on fire for 1 minute. The target takes 2d6 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns while on fire. The flame persists until a creature takes an action to douse the flame, or it completely enters a region the flame cannot burn, such as a body of water.  
***Thunder (Cost: 1d6).*** The target makes a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 15 feet away from you by an intense current of air.

## Level 13: Mixed Elements
When you use Energy Infusion to change your Sneak Attack’s damage type, you can choose to divide the damage dice as you please between Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire and Thunder. To use one of your Elemental Strikes options, you must subtract the cost from dice dealing the corresponding damage type.  
In addition, you can cast the following spells without the need for components or expending a spell slot: Control Water, Fly, Stone Shape and Fire Shield. Dexterity is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t cast it or any of the other options until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 17: Elemental Assault
When you use Energy Infusion to change your Sneak Attack’s damage type, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target, other than the target itself, takes 3d6 damage of one of the damage type you chose as they are assailed by earth, water, fire or air.
