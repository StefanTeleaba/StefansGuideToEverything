# Arachnoid Stalker
*Valda's Spire of Secrets: Player Pack*

*Sling Webs and Crawl Walls*

*A life-changing event, such as being cursed by a drider or being bitten by a dangerously transmuted arachnid, has imbued you with the abilities of a spider. This transformation might have left you physically unchanged, or you may have developed a half-dozen eyes, lanky and hairy limbs, or a set of inhuman mandibles. Whatever the side effects, you can now produce deadly poison and ropes of silken web from your palms, and even scale walls with your fingertips.*

## Level 3: Webbing
You can magically produce sticky, silken spider webs from your hands as a Bonus Action. This web dissolves after 1 minute. When you create the webs, you can use them to do one of the following.  
***Pull Yourself.*** You project a line of web at a point you can see within 30 feet, pulling yourself to that point in a straight line without provoking Opportunity Attacks. You can use this benefit as a Reaction when you fall to pull yourself up to 10 feet in any direction.  
***Manipulate Objects.*** You can use a line of web to manipulate an object that isn't being worn or carried within 30 feet. For example, you can pull an object to your hand, close a door, or snatch a Small or smaller object weighing less than 10 pounds.  
***Create Rope.*** You create a 60-foot-long Rope of web and anchor it to a point you choose.  
***Web Spell.*** You cast Web without a spell slot as a part of the Bonus Action used for this feature (DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). When you cast it using this feature, the webs fill a 5-foot Cube, and the spell's duration becomes 1 minute. You can cast this spell using this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Venomous Strike
When you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can choose for the Sneak Attack to deal d8s of Poison damage instead of d6s of the same type dealt by the weapon.

## Level 9: Wall Crawling
You've become accustomed to moving like a spider, granting you the following benefits.  
***Climber.*** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.  
***Hiding on Ceilings.*** If you are on a ceiling and Lightly Obscured, you can take the Hide action as long as any enemy that could see you is below you.  
***Spider Climb.*** You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

## Level 13: Spider Sense
When you make a saving throw and take damage, you can take a Reaction to use your Uncanny Dodge, halving the damage you take (round down).

## Level 17: Paralytic Venom
You gain the following Cunning Strike option.  
***Paralyze (Cost: 4d6).*** When you deal Poison damage with your Venomous Strike, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Paralyzed condition until the end of your next turn.
