# Misfortune Bringer
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*Curse Those You're About to Strike*  
You've matched your penchant for illicit activities with the ability to mark your enemies for mishap and misfortune. Whether you were imbued with magic by spending time among the Fey or you learned the art of cursing from a long line of hedge Wizards, you are a Misfortune Bringer. Although not universal, many Misfortune Bringers possess heterochromia iridum—eyes of two different colors—and they use only one when glaring at targets they intend to curse.

## Level 3: Evil Eye
You can place a minor curse with a glance. As a Bonus Action, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to be cursed by your Evil Eye. While a creature is cursed by your Evil Eye, you can deal Sneak Attack damage to the creature if you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.  
The creature remains cursed by your Evil Eye for 1 minute or until you curse a different creature with your Evil Eye, whichever comes first.

## Level 3: Misfortunist
You learn Misfortunes that you can inflict on those cursed by your Evil Eye.  
***Misfortunes.*** You learn two Misfortunes of your choice, which are detailed under "Misfortunes" below.  
You learn an additional Misfortune of your choice when you reach Rogue levels 9, 13, and 17. When you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one Misfortune you know with a different one.  
***Jinx Points.*** You have 4 Jinx Points. You gain 2 additional Jinx Points at Rogue level 13. To use a Misfortune option, you must spend the number of Jinx Points that it costs.  
You regain all expended Jinx Points when you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
***Saving Throws.*** If a Misfortune requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your Charisma or Intelligence modifier (your choice) + your Proficiency Bonus.

## Level 9: Steal Luck
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself is about to make a D20 Test with Advantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage. When you do so, you regain 1 expended Jinx Point.  
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

## Level 13: Curse Caster
You can take a Magic action and spend 3 Jinx Points to cast Bestow Curse.

## Level 17: Improved Steal Luck
You can use your Steal Luck feature three times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
