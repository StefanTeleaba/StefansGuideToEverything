# Highway Rider
*Grim Hollow: Player's Guide 2024 v5.5*

*A Steed Makes the Best Partner in Crime*  
Stalking the backroads, the Highway Rider strikes fear into the heart of every traveler and penny-pinching merchant. They run down their prize astride a swift and loyal steedâ€”and then make a quick getaway.

## Level 3: Hair Trigger
You gain proficiency with Blackpowder Pistols. In addition, when you roll Initiative and don't have Disadvantage on that roll, you can immediately take a Reaction for one of the following options:
- Make one attack with a weapon or Unarmed Strike.
- Move up to your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
- A controlled mount moves up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
- Take the Dodge or Utilize action.

## Level 3: Trusty Mount
You always have the Find Steed spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence.  
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 3: Ride Them Down
You don't need Advantage on the attack roll to Sneak Attack if you or a controlled mount you ride moves at least 20 feet, and you don't have Disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Level 9: Horse Lord
You can spend 1 minute grooming and caring for your mount, at the end of which it gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Rogue level.  
In addition, your cunning extends to your steed. While you control a mount, it can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Dodge.

## Level 13: True Grit
You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws. In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

## Level 17: Desperado
When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can use your Hair Trigger feature immediately before you fall Unconscious.
