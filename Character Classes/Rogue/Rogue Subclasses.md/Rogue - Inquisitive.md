As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your sharp eye make you well equipped to expose and end hidden evils.

## Level 3: Meticulous
Your senses are incredibly sharp.  
***Ear for Deceit.*** You develop a keen ear for picking out lies. You have proficiency and Expertise in the Insight skill. If you already have Expertise in it, you instead gain Expertise in a different skill you have proficiency in its place.  
***Eye for Detail.*** You can use the Search or Study action as a Bonus Action.

## Level 3: Insightful Fighting
You gain the ability to decipher an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them. As a Bonus Action, you can force a creature to make a Charisma saving throw (DC equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute, or until you successfully use this feature against a different target:  
***Insightful Strikes.*** You can use your Sneak Attack against the target even if you don't have Advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have Disadvantage on it.  
***Deciphered Tactics.*** You add 1d4 to attack rolls you make against the target, and to saving throws against effects they force you to make.

## Level 9: Steady Eye
Your observation skills are unparalleled. You have Advantage on Investigation and Perception checks if you move no more than half your Speed on the same turn.

## Level 9: Strategize
You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack. The following effect is now among your Cunning Strike options.  
***Scrutinize (Cost: 1d6).*** On your next turn, you have Advantage on your first attack against the target.

## Level 13: Unerring Eye
Your senses are almost impossible to foil. As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but you gain no insight into what is hidden or into its true nature. You can use this feature three times, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use of it at level 17.

## Level 17: Eye for Weakness
You learn to exploit a creature's weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement. While your Insightful Fighting feature applies to a creature, the cost of your Cunning Strike options against that creature are each reduced by 2d6, to a minimum cost of 0 dice.
