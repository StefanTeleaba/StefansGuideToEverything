Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.

## Level 3: Master of Intrigue
You possess the skills and knowledge to blend into your environment, no matter the occasion.  
***Mastermindâ€™s Toolset.*** You gain a Disguise Kit, a Forgery Kit and one Gaming Set of your choice. You have proficiency in each of them.  
***Polyglot.*** You learn two languages of your choice. Additionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.

## Level 3: Master of Tactics
You can use your mastery over battlefield tactics to more skillfully direct your allies.  
***Swift Aid.*** You can use the Help action as a Bonus Action.  
***Keen Advice.*** When you use the Help action to aid an ally in making an ability check, that creature can be within 30 feet of  you, rather than 5 feet from you, provided the ally can see or hear you.  
***Expose Weaknesses.*** When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of you, provided the target and the ally can both see or hear you. If the attack you aided hits, the ally adds half the number of your Sneak Attack dice (rounded down) to the damage roll.

## Level 9: Expert Eye
You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.  
***Discern (Cost: 1d6).*** The DM tells you if the creature is equal, superior, or inferior to you in two ability scores of your choice.  
***Uncover (Cost: 1d6).*** The next time you deal Sneak Attack damage to this creature before the end of your next turn, one of the Cunning Strike options you use on that Sneak Attack costs up to 2d6 less to use, to a minimum cost of 0 dice.

## Level 13: Misdirection
You can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your Reaction to choose another creature within 5 feet of you. The triggering attack hits the chosen creature instead.

## Level 17: Soul of Deceit
Your keen mind is not easily influenced.  
***Mastery Over Mind.*** You have Advantage on Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws. If you succeed on a saving throw using one of these abilities, you can cause the creature that forced you to make the saving throw to take Psychic damage equal to your Rogue level. Once you deal this damage, you cannot do so again until the start of your next turn.  
***False Thoughts.*** Your thoughts can't be read by Telepathy or other means, unless you allow it. You can present false thoughts to a creature attempting to read your mind.  
***Hidden Truth.*** No matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates you are being truthful if you so choose, and you can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic.
