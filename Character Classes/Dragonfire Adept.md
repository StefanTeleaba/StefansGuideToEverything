## Level 1: Breath Weapon
As an Action on your turn, you can choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison and exhale magical energy in either a 15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide (choose the damage type and shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the chosen type. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.  
This damage increases as you gain Dragonfire Adept levels, as shown in the Breath Weapon column of the Dragonfire Adept Features table.

## Level 1: Draconic Resilience
The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Dragonfire Adept level.  
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

## Level 1: Draconic Invocations
You gain one invocation of your choice. Invocations are described in the "Draconic Invocation Options" section later in this class's description.  
***Prerequisites.*** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Dragonfire Adept, you can select the invocation once you reach Dragonfire Adept level 5.  
***Replacing and Gaining Invocations.*** Whenever you gain a Dragonfire Adept level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.  
When you gain certain Dragonfire Adept levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Dragonfire Adept Features table.  
You can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

## Level 2: Breath Effect
Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your breath weapon to suit your needs. When you deal damage with your Breath Weapon, you can add one of the following Breath effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Breath Weapon damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the breath weapon's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d10 from the Breath Weapon's damage before rolling.  
If a Breath Effect effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
***Poison (Cost: 1d10).*** You add a toxin to your breath, forcing the targets to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
