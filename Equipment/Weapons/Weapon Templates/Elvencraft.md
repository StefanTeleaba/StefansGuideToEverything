Bow, Elvencraft: One of the biggest problems facing any
archer is deciding what to do when a foe gets within melee
reach. Does one stand fast and take the consequences (which
can prove painful if not deadly), fall back (not always practical),
or drop the bow and draw a melee weapon (inconvenient
at best). Elf bowyers have made the choice somewhat less
diffi cult by crafting bows that can stand up to melee combat.
Thanks to elven ingenuity, these weapons work just as well
as melee weapons as they do as ranged weapons.
An elvencraft bow is thicker and heavier than a normal
bow. An elvencraft shortbow functions as a club when
wielded as a melee weapon. An elvencraft longbow functions
as a quarterstaff when wielded as a melee weapon. The wielder
incurs no penalty on attack rolls when using an elvencraft
bow as a melee weapon.
A character wielding an elvencraft bow can freely interchange
melee and ranged attacks during the same round. When wielding
an elvencraft bow, the user threatens the squares around
him no matter how he last used the weapon.
Magical enhancements to an elvencraft bow only affect its
use as a bow. Enhancements to the melee capabilities of the
weapon must be added separately.
An elvencraft bow costs 300 gp more than a normal bow.
