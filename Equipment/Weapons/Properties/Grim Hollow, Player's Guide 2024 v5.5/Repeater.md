# Repeater
Repeater weapons can fire ammo in quick succession, using multiple barrels or quick-reloading mechanisms. When you take the Attack action with a Repeater weapon, you can shoot multiple times if you have features that let you attack more than once as part of that action, such as Extra Attack. After taking the Attack action you can use a Bonus Action to attack once with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the Bonus Action's attack, unless that modifier is negative.
