# Blackpowder
Blackpowder weapons fire projectiles with ear-splitting noise, shredding armor with deadly force. When fired, Blackpowder weapons emit a deafening crack audible 300 feet away. A Blackpowder weapon exposed to heavy rain, submerged, or similarly drenched in water, can't fire until dried for 1 hour. These weapons use paper cartridge bullets as ammunition.
