# Magazine
A weapon with the Magazine property also has a number and an ammunition type. The weapon holds that amount and type of ammunition, which you can expend before needing to reload the weapon. As a Bonus Action, you may remove a Magazine and then reload it with a new Magazine. A Magazine weapon comes with two empty magazines included in the weapon's cost and weight. An additional empty magazine for a Magazine weapon costs 25 GP. Loading an empty Magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.
