# Brutal
A Brutal weapon is designed for maximum damage. Brutal weapons score Critical Hits on a natural roll of 19 or 20. If your Critical Range is already increased, instead increase it by 1 point (such as from 19-20 to 18-20). When you score a Critical Hit with a Brutal weapon against a creature, the weapon deals one additional die of damage.
