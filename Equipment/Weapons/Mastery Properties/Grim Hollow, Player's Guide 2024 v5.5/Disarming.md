# Disarming
A Disarming weapon can catch a foe's weapon, allowing you to remove it from their grasp. When you take the Attack action on your turn and hit with a Disarming weapon, you can use your Bonus Action later on the same turn to disarm the target. Both you and the attacker must make opposed attack rolls, ignoring any sources of Advantage and Disadvantage. If your result is higher and the weapon is something the target can drop, the weapon falls from the target's grasp, landing in its space.

If your winning result on the opposed attack roll was a Critical Hit, you can choose for the weapon either to land in a space of your choice up to 15 feet from the target, or to land in your hand if you have a free hand.
