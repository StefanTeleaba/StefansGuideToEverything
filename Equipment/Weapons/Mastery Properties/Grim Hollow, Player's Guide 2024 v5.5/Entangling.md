# Entangling
When you take the Attack action on your turn and hit with an Entangling weapon, you can use a Bonus Action later on the same turn to entangle the target. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10 plus your Proficiency Bonus) or have the Grappled condition until it escapes or until you release the weapon. The target succeeds automatically if it is Huge or larger.

To escape, the target must use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the same DC. On a success, the target no longer has the Grappled condition. While a creature is Grappled by this weapon, you can't use it to attack a different creature.
