# Swift
Swift weapons help you recover quickly from missed attacks. When you miss with a Swift weapon, you have Advantage on the first attack roll you make with the weapon against the same target before the end of your next turn. If that attack hits, it also deals an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's normal damage type.
