# Scatter
Scatter weapons can devastate multiple enemies at once. When you take the Attack action and hit a creature with a Scatter weapon, measure the weapon's scatter range from the target's space (or one square the creature occupies if it is Large or larger). Creatures other than the original target that fall within the weapon's scatter range take damage equal to your 1 + your Dexterity modifier (minimum 2). This damage is of the same type you dealt to the original target.
