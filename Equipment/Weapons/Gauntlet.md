# Gauntlet (2 GP)
*Simple Melee Weapon*  

**Damage:** 1d4 Bludgeoning  
**Properties:** Fist, Light  
**Mastery:** Sap  
**Weight:** 1 lb.

***Fist.*** Attacks made with this weapon are treated as Unarmed Strikes.
***Light.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.
