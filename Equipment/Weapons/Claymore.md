***Two-Handed.*** A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.  
***Mastery: Brutal.*** A Brutal weapon is designed for maximum damage. Brutal weapons score Critical Hits on a natural roll of 19 or 20. If your Critical Range is already increased, instead increase it by 1 point (such as from 19-20 to 18-20).  
When you score a Critical Hit with a Brutal weapon against a creature, the weapon deals one additional die of damage.
