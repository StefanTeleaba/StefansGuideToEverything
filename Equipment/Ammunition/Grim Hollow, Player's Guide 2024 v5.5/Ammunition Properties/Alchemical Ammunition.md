# Alchemical Ammunition
Alchemical Ammunition carries an alchemical payload. Rather than hurling a vial, you fire Alchemical Ammunition from a Ranged weapon, using your normal attack bonus with that weapon.

Alchemical Ammunition is heavier than normal; the weapon's normal and long ranges are halved. The Alchemical Ammunition is destroyed once used, whether the attack hits or misses.

***Acid, Alchemist's Fire, and Holy Water.*** When one of these pieces of Alchemical Ammunition hits, it deals the ammunition's normal damage, then applies the effect of the listed item to the target. No saving throw is allowed against this effect.

***War Oil.*** A target hit by a piece of Alchemical Ammunition packed with War Oil takes damage as normal for the ammunition, then becomes coated in War Oil for up to 1 minute. Alternatively, you can target a point, such as the ground or a wall, and on an attack roll against AC 10, cause the War Oil to spill out of the ammunition, creating a circular patch of the viscous substance with a 10-foot radius.

War Oil is slick and highly flammable. An area coated in War Oil counts as Difficult Terrain, and a creature that starting its turn in a coated area or enters the coated area for the first time on a turn must succeed a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or gain the Prone condition and have its Speed reduced to 0 until the end of its turn.

Additionally, if a creature or area coated with War Oil is exposed to an open flame or some other source of Fire damage, the oil ignites. The ignited oil burns for two rounds, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature or object who comes in contact with it, and an additional 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that ends its turn while in contact with it. An ignited creature can douse the flames by using an action.

After burning for two rounds, being doused, or remaining unlit for 1 minute, War Oil dries up and ceases to be slippery or flammable.
