# Damage Types
Advanced Ammunition named after a damage type deals that damage type. Arrows and bolts can have wide heads that deal Slashing damage or blunt tips that deal Bludgeoning damage. A sling bullet can have facets that deal Piercing damage. All such ammo is heavier than normal; the weapon's maximum range while using it is halved.
