# Whistling
Ammunition with the Whistling property creates a high-pitched sound after firing. This sound is audible out to 300 feet from the ammo as it flies. Whistling ammo isn't heavier, but it catches the air with intricate baffles to create its sound, so its maximum range is half normal. Whistling ammo deals Bludgeoning damage.
