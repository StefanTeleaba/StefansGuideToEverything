# Smashing an Object



---
*Player's Handbook v3.5, p.165*

**Armor Class:** Objects are easier to hit than creatures because
they usually don’t move, but many are tough enough to shrug
off some damage from each blow. An object’s Armor Class is
equal to 10 + its size modifier + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate
object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (–5 penalty to AC), but
also an additional –2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if you take
a full-round action to line up a shot, you get an automatic hit
with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls with a
ranged weapon.
**Hardness:** Each object has hardness—a number that represents
how well it resists damage. Whenever an object takes
damage, subtract its hardness from the damage. Only damage in
excess of its hardness is deducted from the object’s hit points (see
Table 9–8: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and
Hit Points; Table 9–9: Substance Hardness and Hit Points; and
Table 9–11: Object Hardness and Hit Points).
**Hit Points:** An object’s hit point total depends on what it is
made of and how big it is (see Table 9–8, Table 9–9, and Table
9–11). When an object’s hit points reach 0, it’s ruined.
Very large objects have separate hit point totals for
different sections. For example, you can attack and ruin a
wagon wheel without destroying the whole wagon.
Energy Attacks: Acid and sonic attacks deal
damage to most objects just as they do to creatures;
roll damage and apply it normally
after a successful hit. Electricity
and fire attacks deal half damage
to most objects; divide the
damage dealt by 2 before
applying the hardness. Cold
attacks deal one-quarter
damage to most objects;
divide the damage dealt
by 4 before applying
the hardness.
Ranged Weapon Damage:
Objects take half
damage from ranged weapons
(unless the weapon is a
siege engine or something
similar). Divide the damage
dealt by 2 before applying the
object’s hardness.
Ineffective Weapons: The DM may
determine that certain weapons just
can’t effectively deal damage to certain
objects. For example, you may have a
hard time chopping down a door by
shooting arrows at it or cutting a rope
with a club.
Immunities: Objects are immune to
nonlethal damage and to critical hits.
Even animated objects, which are otherwise considered
creatures, have these immunities because
they are constructs.
Magic Armor, Shields, and Weapons: Each +1
of enhancement bonus adds 2 to the hardness
of armor, a weapon, or a shield and +10 to the
item’s hit points. For example, a +1 longsword has hardness
12 and 15 hp, while a +3 heavy steel shield has hardness
16 and 50 hp.
Vulnerability to Certain Attacks: The DM may rule that certain
attacks are especially successful against some objects. For example,
it’s easy to light a curtain on fire, chop down a tree with an ax, or rip
up a scroll. In such cases, attacks deal double their normal damage
and may (at the DM’s discretion) ignore the object’s hardness.
Damaged Objects: A damaged object remains fully functional until
the item’s hit points are reduced to 0, at which point it is destroyed.
For instance, the wielder of a damaged weapon takes no penalty
due to the weapon’s damage, and damaged armor and shields still
provide their full normal bonus to AC. Damaged (but not
destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Craft skill (see page 70).
Saving Throws: Nonmagical, unattended items never make
saving throws. They are considered to have failed their saving
throws, so they always are affected by (for instance) a disintegrate
spell. An item attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or
worn) makes saving throws as the character (that is, using the
character’s saving throw bonus).
