# Scribing Spell Scrolls
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.

## Cost
To determine the crafting cost of scribing a spell, multiply the level of the spell and the level of the spellcaster by 25 GP and add the cost of any Material components that the spell consumes.  
The purchase cost of a scroll is equal to twice its crafting cost.

## Time
To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to scribe a spell, divide its crafting cost in GP by 100. If a scroll requires multiple days, the days needn't be consecutive.

## Prerequisites for the Scribe
To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or with Calligrapher's Tools and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
