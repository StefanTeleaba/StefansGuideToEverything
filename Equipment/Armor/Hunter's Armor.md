# Hunter's Armor
*Advanced equipment*  
*500 gp*

Hunter's Armor is a favorite of monster hunters across the length and breadth of Etharis. Any type of armor can be constructed as Hunter's Armor by paying the listed extra cost. This reinforces the most vital areas with adamantine and mithral threads to turn devastating hits into normal wounds.

If a blow would cause a Grievous Wound, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the blow does not deliver a Grievous Wound.
