# Tower Shield
*Armor (shield)*  
*200 gp, 50 lb.*

This large shield provides more protection than a typical shield. While wielding a Tower Shield, you gain +3 to Armor Class. If you use an action to set the Tower Shield, you have Three-Quarters Cover until the start of your next turn. Additionally, your Speed becomes 0 and cannot be increased during that time.

To wield a Tower Shield, you must have a Strength of at least 15 and your Speed is reduced by 10 feet while wielding the shield.
