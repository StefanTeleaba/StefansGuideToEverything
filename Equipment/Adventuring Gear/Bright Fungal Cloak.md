# Bright Fungal Cloak
*Adventuring Gear*  
25 GP, 4 lb.

While wearing a Bright Fungal Cloak, you can take a Bonus Action to furl or unfurl it. When the cloak is unfurled, it sheds Bright Light in a 5-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 5 feet.

One pound of fungus is sewn into a Bright Fungal Cloak. This fungus can be eaten as food. Once all the fungus is consumed, the cloak becomes a mundane set of Traveler's Clothes.
