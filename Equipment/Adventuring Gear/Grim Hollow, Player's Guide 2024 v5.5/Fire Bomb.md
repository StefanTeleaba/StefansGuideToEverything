# Fire Bomb
*Advanced equipment*  
*100 gp, ½ lb.*

You can throw a Fire Bomb by using an Attack action. Target one space you can see within 20 feet. A creature in this space must make on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature in that space takes 2d6 Slashing damage and 4d6 Fire damage and starts Burning. Creatures adjacent to the attacked space take half that damage and are not Burning.
