# Noisemaker
*Advanced equipment*  
*50 gp, 5 lb.*

This small mechanical device is a specialty of gnomish crafters. As a Utilize action, you can throw the Noisemaker into a space within 60 feet. When it lands, it makes a loud noise of some kind, depending on the whims of the creator: a musical clash, a whistling, a whirring, a buzzing, etc. This noise can be heard up to half a mile away.

A creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or less that is within 60 feet of the device when it goes off must succeed in a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the Frightened condition for one minute. As an Influence action, another creature who the Frightened creature can see or hear can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) or Charisma (Persuasion) check. On a success, the Frightened condition ends on that creature.
