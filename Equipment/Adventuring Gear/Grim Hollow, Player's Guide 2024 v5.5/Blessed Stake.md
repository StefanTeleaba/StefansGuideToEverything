# Blessed Stake
*Advanced equipment*  
*250 gp, 1.6 oz.*

A Blessed Stake is a necessary tool in the arsenal of vampire hunters everywhere. This wooden spike, roughly a foot in length, has been blessed by a servant of an Arch Seraph in a special ceremony.

As an Attack action, a wielder can make a melee attack using Strength. Against most foes, this deals 1d4 Piercing damage. Against a Vampire that has the Stunned or Incapacitated condition, a successful attack with the Blessed Stake kills the Vampire.

If the Vampire is CR 10 or lower, the Vampire instantly crumbles to dust. If the Vampire is more powerful, its form remains whole for one year before crumbling to dust. If the Blessed Stake is removed before then, the Vampire rises with 1 Hit Point.
