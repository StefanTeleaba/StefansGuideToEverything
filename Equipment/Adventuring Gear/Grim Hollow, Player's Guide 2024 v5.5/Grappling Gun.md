# Grappling Gun
*Advanced equipment*  
*200 gp, 3 lb.*

A Grappling Gun can shoot a Grappling Hook attached to a rope up to 150 feet, and the hook catches with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

Additionally, if you are falling, you can use a Reaction to shoot the Grappling Gun at an attachable surface to stop your fall. You still must succeed on the check to ensure the Grappling Hook catches on a solid object. On a successful check, you stop your fall.
