# Superior Technique
*Fighting Style Feat (Prerequisite: Fighting Style Feature)*  

***Maneuvers.*** You learn one maneuver of your choice from the "Maneuver Options" section of the Battle Master Fighter. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.  
***Superiority Dice.*** You have one Superiority Die, which is a d8. The Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain expended Superiority Dice when you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
***Saving Throws.*** If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) and Proficiency Bonus.
