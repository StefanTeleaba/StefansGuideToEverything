You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Enhanced Dual Wielding.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon that has the Light property, you can make two extra attacks as a Bonus Action later on the same turn with a different weapon, which must be a Melee weapon that lacks the Two-Handed property. You don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative.
