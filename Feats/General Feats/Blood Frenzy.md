# Blood Frenzy
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Proficiency with at least one natural weapon)*

You are capable of harnessing a deep, primal bloodlust, which you can channel into attacks you make with your fangs, claws, or other natural weapons that you bear.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** You increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Flurry.*** Whenever you use the attack action to make an attack with a natural weapon, you can use your bonus action to make an additional attack with a natural weapon.  
***Primal Mark.*** Immediately before taking the attack action, you can mark a creature that is missing any of its hit points. You have advantage on attack rolls made with natural weapons against the marked creature until the end of your turn. You can mark a creature in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest. You cannot mark constructs or undead in this way.
