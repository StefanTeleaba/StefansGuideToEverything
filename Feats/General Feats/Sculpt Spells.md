# Sculpt Spells
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic Feature)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Sculpt Spells.*** When you cast a spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to half your Proficiency Bonus. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
