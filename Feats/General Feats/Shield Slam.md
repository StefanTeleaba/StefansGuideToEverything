# Shield Slam
*General Feat (Prerequisites: Level 4+; Shield Master)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Shield Slam.*** If you attack a creature within 5 feet of you as part of the Attack action and hit with a Melee weapon, you can immediately bash the target with your Shield if it's equipped, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the target has the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit only once on each of your turns.
