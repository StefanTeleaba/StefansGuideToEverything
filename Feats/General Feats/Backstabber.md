# Backstabber
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Dexterity 13+)*

***Ability Score Increase.*** You increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Backstab.*** While you are within 5 feet of a creature, you can attempt to slip behind it as a Bonus Action without expending movement. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failure, the next damage roll you make before the end of the current turn with a dagger deals additional damage equal to your level + your Proficiency Bonus.
