# Disciple of Darkness
*General Feat (Prerequisites: Level 4+)*

*You formally supplicate yourself to an archdevil. In return for this obedience, you gain a small measure of the archdevil's power.*

You gain the following benefits.    
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Disciple of Darkness.*** You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
