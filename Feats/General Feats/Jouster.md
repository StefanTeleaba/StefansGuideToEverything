# Jouster
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Proficiency with the Lance)*

You have trained in the art of the joust, and have become adept at dismounting adversaries, granting you the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** You increase your Strength or Constitution modifier by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Dismounting Strike.*** When you hit a creature with a Lance while mounted, you can attempt to shove the target as a part of the same attack.  
***Runup.*** When you make an attack with a Lance, you can add 1d12 to the damage roll on a hit, provided that you move at least 30 feet in a straight line immediately before you make the attack. If you are mounted when you make this attack, the distance the creature is pushed on a successful shove attempt increases by 5 feet.
