# Metamagic Adept
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Metamagic Feature)*  
*Homebrew*

You've learned how to exert your will on your spells to alter how they function:  
***Ability Score Improvement.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Metamagic.*** You learn two Metamagic options of your choice from the "Metamagic Options" section of the Sorcerer. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.  
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.  
Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don't know.
