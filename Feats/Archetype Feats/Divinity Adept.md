# Divinity Adept
[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  

*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archtype Feat)*  

***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Channel Divinity.*** You gain the Channel Divinity feature from the Cleric class, gaining access to the Divine Spark and Turn Undead abilities. You have only one use of Channel Divinity that you can use to fuel these abilities, which you regain when you finish a Short or Long Rest. Your spellcasting ability for these effects is the ability increased by this feat, and you add that ability's modifier to the Divine Spark roll instead of Wisdom (if applicable).  
If you have two or more levels in Cleric, you instead simply increase your number of uses of Channel Divinity by 1.
