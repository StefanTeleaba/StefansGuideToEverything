*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archtype Feat)*  

***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Action Surge.*** You gain one use of the Action Surge feature from the Fighter class. When you use the additional action to take the Attack action, you can only make one attack. Once you use Action Surge using this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
If you have two or more levels in Fighter, you do not regain this extra use when you finish a Short Rest, but you are not restricted in the number of attacks you can make with this action.
