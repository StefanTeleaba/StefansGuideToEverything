# Wild Shape Adept
[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  

*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archtype Feat)*  

***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Wild Shape.*** You gain the Wild Shape feature from the Druid class, and you know two of the forms that are available to Druids at level 2. You only have one use for the feature, which you regain when you finish a Short or Long Rest. When you transform, the number of Temporary Hit Points you gain is equal to your Proficiency Bonus instead of your Druid level, and you can stay transfomred for 1 hour, instead of Wild Shape's normal duraiton.  
If you have two or more levels in Druid, you instead simply increase your number of Wild Shape uses by 1, and your number of known forms by 2.
