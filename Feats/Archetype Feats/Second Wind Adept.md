[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  

*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archtype Feat)*  

***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Second Wind.*** You gain one use of the Second Wind feature from the Fighter class. When you use this feature, the number of Hit Points you regain is equal to 1d10 plus your Proficiency Bonus. Once you use Second Wind using this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
If you have any levels in Fighter, you instead simply increase your number of uses of Second Wind by 1.
