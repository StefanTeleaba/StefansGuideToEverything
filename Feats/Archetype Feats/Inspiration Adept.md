[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  

*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archetype Feat)*  

***Ability score Increase.*** Increase your Dexterity or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Instrument Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice.  
***Bardic Inspiration.*** You gain a number of uses of the Bardic Inspiration feature from the Bard class equal to half your Proficiency Bonus (round up). Your Bardic Inspiration die is a d6, and you regain expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
If you have any levels in Bard, you use your normal Bardic Inspiration die instead of a d6. These extra uses are not affected by the Font of Inspiration feature.
