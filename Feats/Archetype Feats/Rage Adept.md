# Rage Adept
[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  

*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archetype Feat)*  
***Ability score Increase.*** Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Rage.*** You gain the Rage feature from the Barbarian class. When you use Rage using this feat, you do not benefit from the damage Resistances of the feature. Once you use Rage in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
If you have any levels in Barbarian, you instead simply increase your number of uses of Rage by 1.
