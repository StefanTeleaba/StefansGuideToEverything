[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  

*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archetype Feat)*  

***Ability score Increase.*** Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Rage.*** You gain the Rage feature from the Barbarian class. When you use Rage using this feat, your Rage Damage bonus is +2, and the only way to extend your Rage is to take a Bonus Action to extend it until the end of your next turn. Furthermore, the Rage can only last for a maximum of 1 minute. Once you use Rage in this way, you can»ôt do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
If you have any levels in Barbarian, you instead simply increase your number of uses of Rage by 1.
