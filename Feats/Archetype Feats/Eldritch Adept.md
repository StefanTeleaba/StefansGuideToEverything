[*Created by Spaghetti0*](https://bio.site/spaghetti0)  

*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, the Spellcasting or Pact Magic Feature, Can't have another Archetype Feat)*  

***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Eldritch Invocation.*** You gain the Eldritch Invocation feature from the Warlock Class. You only learn one invocation of your choice from the list available to Warlocks at level 2, but your selection must have no other prerequisites. Your spellcasting ability for the Invocation is the ability increased by this feat. Whenever you gain a level, you can exchange your chosen Invocation with another eligible choice.  
If you have two or more levels in Warlock, you instead simply increase your number of Eldritch Invocations by 1.
