# I Fought, I Lived
*Origin Feat*

*You confronted a horror from beyond this world or spawned by terrible magic. It disregarded you as a puny mortal, but it learned its mistake the hard way when you sent it back to wherever it came from with good, old-fashioned muscle, courage, and a really, really large axe.*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Defiant Strike.*** While you are Bloodied and hit with a spell or weapon attack, you can choose to treat the attack's damage roll as having rolled the maximum damage possible. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.  
***Indomitable Heart.*** If you have the Frightened condition at the start of your turn, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you no longer have that condition.
