*Origin Feat*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Magic Absorption.*** Once per turn, when you take damage from a spell or magical effect, you reduce the total damage taken by 1d4. You can't use this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition.  
***Spellfire Flame.*** You learn the Sacred Flame cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). You can also cast this cantrip as a Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
