# Oathbound Adept
*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archetype Feat)*  

***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Divine Smite.*** You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it with any other spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (choose when you select this feat).  
***Lay on Hands.*** As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature and restore a number of Hit Points to it equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus. You regain the ability to use this Bonus Action when you finish a Long Rest.  
If you have any levels of Paladin, you instead increase your Hit Point pool for your Lay on Hands feature by twice your Proficiency Bonus.
