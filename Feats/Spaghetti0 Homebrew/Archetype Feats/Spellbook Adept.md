# Spellbook Adept
*Archetype Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Can't have another Archetype Feat)*  

***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Spellbook.*** You gain a special spellbook, in which you can store Wizard spells with the Ritual tag. You start with two such spells of your choice in the book, which can be of level 1 or 2. The spellbook can be replaced or expanded upon in the same way that Wizards canm described in the 'Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook' sidebar in the Wizard class. You can only cast spells in this spellbook as a Ritual, and your spellcasting ability for them is the ability increased by this feat.  
If you have any levels in Wizard, you instead add two level 1-2 Wizard spells with the Ritual tag to your Spellbook for free. Furthermore, you gain the ability to copy non-Wizard spells into your spellbook. The spells must have the Ritual tag, and must be of a level you can prepare as a Wizard. Such spells count as Wizard spells for youm but you can only cast them as a Ritual.  
If you later gain your first level in Wizard, you copy the spells you learned through this feat into your main spellbook for free.
