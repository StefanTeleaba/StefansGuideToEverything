# Whip Specialist
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Proficiency with the Whip)*

You have mastered skills to take advantage of the pain-inflicting properties of the Whip, as well as its usefulness as a grappling tool. You gain the following benefits:  
***Ability Score Increase.*** You increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Light Whip.*** You can use Whips as if they have the Light property.  
***Whip Grapple.*** When you hit a creature with a whip, you can choose to not deal damage, and instead use the Whip to cause the creature to be Grappled by you. You do not require a free hand to perform this grapple, but it ends early if you are no longer wielding the Whip and you cannot make any attacks with it until the grapple ends. The target can be no more than one size larger than you.  
***Painful Lash.*** When you deal damage to a creature with an attack made with a Whip, the target is wreaked with pain. The target suffers a penalty equal to your Proficiency Bonus to Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration resulting from this instance of damage, and suffers the same penalty to ability checks it makes until the end of its next turn.
