# I Hid from the Terror
*Origin Feat*

*That night is a blur. A strange presence, an overwhelming terror, and a confused jumble of screams mixed with faint memories of something terrible and hungry. You hid from it, finding a place too small for it to reach. The sounds of that night, and the awful aftermath you found that morning, will remain with you to the end of your days and beyond.*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Shadowed Strike.*** If attacking would end the Invisible condition on you, you can make an attack and keep that condition. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Beneath Notice.*** When you attempt to hide from a creature that is larger than you, you can hide if you are lightly obscured or more than 30 feet away from it. You gain the benefits of being hidden against such creatures, but you do not hide from other creatures.  
***Merge into Shadows.*** Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect you while you have the Invisible condition have Disadvantage.
