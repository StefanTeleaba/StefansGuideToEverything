# I Pierced the Illusion
*Origin Feat*

*You came across something strange and awful, made all the more terrible by its hidden nature. A town might have seemed innocent until it dragged unwitting visitors to their carefully tended sacrificial garden, or the family that took you in on a dark, stormy night were actually hungry cannibals. You survived because you saw their disguise and escaped or struck first.*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Clear Senses.*** If you have the Charmed condition at the start of your turn, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you no longer have that condition.  
***Ear for Falsehood.*** When an NPC speaks to you, you can use this ability to determine if they are lying. You learn nothing about the truth they conceal or why they are lying, simply that there is a knowing falsehood in their statement. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Subtle Interrogation.*** You have Advantage on Insight checks made against creatures that you are speaking with.
