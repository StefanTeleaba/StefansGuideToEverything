# I Survived to Tell the Tale
*Origin Feat*

*You encountered something dreadful, a horrible creature or bizarre ritual that set you down the path to becoming an investigator of the strange. Your quick feet and instinct for survival carried you through that day and are your best assets.*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Instinct to Survive.*** When you take damage that would reduce you to 0 Hit Points, you can immediately regain Hit Points equal to your level. When you use this benefit, you cannot use it again until you finish a Long Rest.  
***Superior Speed.*** You gain a +10 bonus to Speed.  
***Wriggle Free.*** If you would gain the Grappled condition, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you instead do not gain it.
