# I Opened the Gate
*Origin Feat*

*You didn't mean for things to turn out this way. You were curious and perhaps ignored a few signs, but it's hard to take ancient curses seriously. Musty old books say a lot of things, and most of them turn out to be mere fables. Most of them. The one book you read turned out to be the key to unleashing some ancient evil. Now it's in the world, and it's up to you to find it and send it back.*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Delver into Forgotten Lore.*** You learn three languages of your choice.  
***Foul Arcana.*** You can tap into a brief glimpse of the mythos to empower a spell, at the cost of overwhelming your mind with a horrifying, cosmic insight. When you cast a spell, you can give that spell's save DC a +2 bonus but you have the Paralyzed condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
