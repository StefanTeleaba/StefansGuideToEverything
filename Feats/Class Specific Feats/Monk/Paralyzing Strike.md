# Paralyzing Strike
*Class Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Stunning Strike Feature)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength, Dexterity or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Paralyzing Strike.*** Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 2 Focus Points to attempt a paralyzing strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Paralyzed condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target's Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.
