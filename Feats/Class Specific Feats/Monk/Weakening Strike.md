# Weakening Strike
*Class Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Martial Arts Feature)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength, Dexterity or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Weakening Strike.*** Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.  
On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage on Strength-based D20 Tests until the start of your next turn. During that time, it also subtracts two rolls of your Martial Arts die from all its damage rolls.
