# Doomspeak
*Class Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Bardic Inspiration Feature)*

*You can demoralize an enemy with horrible condemnations and grim portents of impending doom.*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Doomspeak.*** As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration to attempt to demoralize a creature within 120 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target gains a -10 penalty on D20 tests until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes.
