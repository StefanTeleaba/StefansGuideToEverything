# Witch Hunter
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)*

You have honed and perfected your skills fighting against spellcasters, possibly from your background hunting mages as part of the Arcanist Inquisition. You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Dodge Spells.*** You can take a Reaction to avoid a spell that is targeting only you and doesn't create an area of effect. Make a Wisdom saving throw against the spellcaster's spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature must choose a new target or the spell is canceled. A canceled spell dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted.  
***Keep Your Enemies Close.*** When you hit a target that can cast spells with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can reduce its Speed by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.  
***Resist Curses.*** You have Advantage on saving throws against all Shadowsteel curses, and also against spells with a duration of more than 10 minutes.
