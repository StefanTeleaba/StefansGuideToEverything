# Syndicate Spy
*General Feat (Prerequisites: Level 4+, Syndicate Smuggler)*

Rising in the ranks of the Ebon Syndicate has taught you the clandestine skills of spycraft, valuable in your trade as a racketeer. You gain the following benefits.  
***Locksmith.*** You have proficiency with Thieves' Tools. While holding Thieves' Tools, you can craft a key to a lock by spending 10 minutes with that lock.  
***Master of Disguise.*** You have proficiency with a Disguise Kit. If you spend 10 minutes donning a Costume, you decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this benefit to become quadrupedal, for instance.  
***Master Calligrapher.*** You have proficiency with a Forgery Kit. You aren't limited to 10 or fewer words when mimicking someone else's handwriting.  
***Blending In.*** When using the Hide action to conceal yourself from creatures that aren't Hostile to you, you need only be Lightly Obscured and you may use Charisma instead of Dexterity for the check.
