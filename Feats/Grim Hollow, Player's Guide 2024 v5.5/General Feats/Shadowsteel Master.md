# Shadowsteel Master
*General Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Shadowsteel Adept)*

Your mastery over Shadowsteel grows stronger. You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Necrotic Harmony.*** While holding your Shadowsteel Focus, when you cast a spell that targets one or more creatures and requires an attack roll or saving throw, you can choose one target you hit or who failed the saving throw to also take 1d4 Necrotic damage for each spell slot level expended to cast the spell.  
***Necrotic Weapon.*** If your Shadowsteel Focus is also a weapon, that weapon has a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls and damage rolls. Additionally, once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack roll using your Shadowsteel Focus, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d8 Necrotic damage.
