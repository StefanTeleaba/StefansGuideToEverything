# Sangromantic Initiate
*General Feat (Prerequisites: Level 4+; Spellcasting or Pact Magic Feature)*

You have become adept enough with weaving blood magic to mitigate some of the harm of Sangromancy. You gain the following benefits.  
***Blood Magic.*** Choose a Sangromancy spell from any spell list of a level for which you have spell slots. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slot you have.  
***Sanguine Potency.*** You have a pool of two d12s that you can expend instead of Hit Point Dice when you cast Sangromancy spells. Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.
