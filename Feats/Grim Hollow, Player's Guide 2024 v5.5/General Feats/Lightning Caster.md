# Lightning Caster
*General Feat (Prerequisites: Level 4+; Spellcasting or Pact Magic Feature)*

Your rapid-fire style of casting cantrips allows you to weave magic with uncanny speed. You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Dual Target.*** When you cast a cantrip with a casting time of an action that targets a single creature, you can use a Bonus Action to target a second creature within the cantrip's range.  
***Immediate Response.*** When you cast a spell as a Reaction, that spell doesn't expend a spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
