# Insightful Collector
*Origin Feat*

Your expeditions, transactions, and mercantile activities on behalf of the Augustine Trading Company have put you in contact with collectors of historical artifacts, relics, and tomes. You gain the following benefits.  
***Object Intuition.*** You can take a Study action to examine one magical object and learn its properties and how to use it without attuning to it or taking a Short Rest in physical contact with it, but you don't learn any curse the item might bear. There is a cumulative 5% chance for every rarity above Common that you misidentify the nature and the power of the object.  
***Rare Find.*** You begin play in possession of a Common magic item. Work with your GM to decide on which object fits your character and the campaign.
