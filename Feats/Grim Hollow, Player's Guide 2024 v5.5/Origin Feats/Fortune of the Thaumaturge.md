# Fortune of the Thaumaturge
*Origin Feat*

Your connection to the Thaumaturge puts you in touch with forces outside mortal understanding, making others think you were born under a fortunate moon. You gain the following benefits.  
***Fortune's Fortitude.*** When you fail a D20 Test, you can expend and roll one Hit Point Die, adding that number to your result. You can do this only once per D20 Test.  
You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Fortune of the Unknown.*** When using the Fortune's Fortitude benefit, if you roll the highest or lowest number on the Hit Point Die, you regain that Hit Point Die. It still counts as a use of Fortune's Fortitude.
