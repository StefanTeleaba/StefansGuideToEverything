# Resolution of the Syndicate
*Origin Feat*

Membership in the Ebon Syndicate provides perksâ€”one of which is the motivation that comes with the understanding that the Syndicate kills those who fail too often. You gain the following benefits.  
***Quick Strike.*** On your first turn after an Initiative roll, add 1d4 to the first damage roll you make. This extra damage increases to 2d4 at character level 9, and to 4d4 at character level 16.  
***Resilient.*** Your Hit Point maximum increases by an amount equal to your character level when you gain this feat. Whenever you gain a character level thereafter, your Hit Point maximum increases by an additional 1 Hit Point.
