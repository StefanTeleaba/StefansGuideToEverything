# Deathbound
*Origin Feat*

You have seen death many times, up close and personal, and sometimes at your own hand. These experiences have affected you deeply, teaching you about life and death. You gain the following benefits.  
***One Last Breath.*** If you have two Death Saving Throw failures, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws until you are no longer at 0 Hit Points.  
***Recuperation.*** When you spend a Hit Point Die during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points, you can roll the Hit Point Die twice and use the higher roll.
