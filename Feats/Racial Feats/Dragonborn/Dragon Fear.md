# Dragon Fear
*Racial Feat (Prerequisite: Dragonborn, Level 4+, Strength or Charisma 13+)*  

You gain the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Strength or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Frightful Presence.*** Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus the modifier of the ability you increased with this feat and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
