# Duergar Magic
*Racial Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)*  

Your exposure to the Underdark's magic grants you the following benefits.  
***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
***Duergar Magic.*** You always have the Enlarge/Reduce spell and the Misty Step spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
