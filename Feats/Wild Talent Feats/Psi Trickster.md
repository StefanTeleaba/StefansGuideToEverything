# Psi Trickster
*Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Canâ€™t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Cunning Mind.*** When you make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum bonus of +1). You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Psionic Talent.*** You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. You also always have the Disguise Self spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have. When you cast these spells, they require no Verbal or Material components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them (choose when you select this feat).
