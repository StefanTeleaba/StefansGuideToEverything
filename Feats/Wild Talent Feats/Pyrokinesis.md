# Pyrokinesis
*Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Canâ€™t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Firestarter.*** Once per turn when you cast a spell or hit with an attack roll and deal Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, or Psychic damage, you can change the damage type to Fire damage.  
***Psionic Talent.*** You know the Produce Flame cantrip. You also always have the Burning Hands spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. When you cast these spells, they require no Verbal or Material components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them (choose when you select this feat).  
When you reach character level 3, you also always have the Scorching Ray spell prepared and can cast it the same way.
