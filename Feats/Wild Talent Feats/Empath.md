# Empath
*Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Canâ€™t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Emotional Sense.*** When you take the Influence action, you can give yourself Advantage on any ability check made as part of that action. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Psionic Talent.*** You always have the Charm Person spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. When you cast the spell, it requires no Verbal components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).  
When you reach character level 3, you also always have the Calm Emotions spell prepared and can cast it the same way.
