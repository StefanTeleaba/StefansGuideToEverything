*Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Canâ€™t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Ice Manipulation.*** Once per turn when you cast a spell or hit with an attack roll and deal Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, or Psychic damage, you can change the damage type to Cold damage.  
***Psionic Talent.*** You know the Ray of Frost cantrip. You also always have the Armor of Agathys and Ice Knife spells prepared. You can cast each spell once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have. When you cast these spells, they require no Verbal or Material components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them (choose when you select this feat).
