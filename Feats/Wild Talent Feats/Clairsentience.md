*Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Can’t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Minor Foreknowledge.*** When you take the Search action, you can give yourself Advantage on any ability check made as part of that action. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Psionic Talent.*** You know the Guidance cantrip. You also always have the Detect Evil and Good spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. When you cast these spells, they require no Verbal or Material components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).  
When you reach character level 3, you also always have the See Invisibility spell prepared and can cast it the same way.
