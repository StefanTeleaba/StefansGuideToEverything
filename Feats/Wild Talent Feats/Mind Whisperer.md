# Mind Whisperer
*Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Can’t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Limited Telepathy.*** As a Magic action, choose one creature you can see within 120 feet of yourself. You form a telepathic connection to that creature. For 1 hour, you and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while within 120 feet of each other. To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.  
Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
***Psionic Talent.*** You know the Mind Sliver cantrip. You also always have the Dissonant Whispers spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have. When you cast these spells, they require no Verbal or Material components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them (choose when you select this feat).
