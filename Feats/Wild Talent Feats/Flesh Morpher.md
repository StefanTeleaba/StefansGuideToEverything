# Flesh Morpher
*Wild Talent Feat (Prerequisite: Canâ€™t Have Another Wild Talent Feat)*

You gain the following benefits.  
***Flexible Flesh.*** When you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand) check, you gain a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
***Psionic Talent.*** You always have the Longstrider spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. When you cast the spell, it requires no Verbal components, and Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).  
When you reach character level 3, you also always have the Alter Self spell prepared and can cast it the same way.
