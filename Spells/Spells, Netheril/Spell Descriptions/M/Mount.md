# Mount
*Level 1 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a strand of horse hair)  
**Duration:** 1 hour  

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.  
For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse stat block. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell lasts 1 additional hour for each spell slot level above 1.
