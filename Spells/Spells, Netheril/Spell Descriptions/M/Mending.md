# Mending
*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.  
This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.
