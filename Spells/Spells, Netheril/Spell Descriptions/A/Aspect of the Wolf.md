# Aspect of the Wolf
*Level 1 Transmutation (Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a whisker from a wolf)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

*With a howl you complete the spell. Instantly, your body sprouts short, thick fur. Your spine and neck bend, causing you to drop to your hands and knees which quickly shorten into canine limbs.*

You assume the form of a Wolf. The spell ends if you have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.  

**Rules While Transformed.** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:  
***Temporary Hit Points.*** When you first assume the Wolf form, you gain 11 Temporary Hit Points.  
***Game Statistics.*** Your game statistics are replaced by the Wolf's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Wolf's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.  
***No Spellcasting.*** You can't cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.  
***Objects.*** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell lasts 1 additional hour for each spell slot level above 1.
