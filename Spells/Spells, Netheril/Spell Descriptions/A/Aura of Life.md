An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic damage, and your Hit Point maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 Hit Points starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 Hit Point.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Emanation extends for an additional 5 feet for each spell slot level above 4.
