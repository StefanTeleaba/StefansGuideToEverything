**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** 90 feet

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You magically mark one creature you can see within range as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 Force damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. You also have Advantage on any Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check you make to find it.  
If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the spell ends, you can transfer the spell to a different creature you can see within range (no action required).  
The target has the Poisoned condition for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the Poisond condition ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Your Concentration can last longer with a spell slot of level 3-4 (up to 8 hours) or 5+ (up to 24 hours).
