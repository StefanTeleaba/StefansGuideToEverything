*Conjuration Cantrip (Druid)*

***Casting Time:*** Bonus Action  
***Range:*** Self  
***Components:*** V, S

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.  
Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).
