# Claws of the Bear
*Level 1 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

*Howling a curse at your enemies, pain explodes in your hands as they suddenly sport long claws. Almost instantly the pain fades. Too bad your foes wonâ€™t be able to say the same.*

When you hit with your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can deal Slashing damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike.
