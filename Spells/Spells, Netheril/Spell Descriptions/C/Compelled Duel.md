## Compelled Duel
*Level 1 Enchantment (Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it can't willingly move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you.  
The spell ends if you cast a spell on an enemy other than the target, if an ally of yours damages the target, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
