*Level 2 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (seven thorns)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 1 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a Search action and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The radius of the spell increases by 10 feet for each spell slot level above 2.
