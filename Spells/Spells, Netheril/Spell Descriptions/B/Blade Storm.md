# Blade Storm
*Level 3 Transmutation (Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Immediate

*With a thought and a word you complete the spell. Your weapons shift color, becoming blue for a moment, and feel lighter in your hands. An unseen force guides them, pulling them toward your enemies.*

You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within your weapon's reach. You make a separate attack roll for each target.
