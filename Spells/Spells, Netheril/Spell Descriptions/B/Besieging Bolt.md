# Besieging Bolt
*Level 6 Evocation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 300 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small stone sprinkled with diamond dust worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You launch a large bolt of force. Make a ranged spell attack against one creature or object in range. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 Force damage. If it hits an object, the hit is automatically a Critical Hit.  
Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to launch a new bolt of force.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 6.
