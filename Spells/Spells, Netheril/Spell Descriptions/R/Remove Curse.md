# Remove Curse
*Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's Attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
