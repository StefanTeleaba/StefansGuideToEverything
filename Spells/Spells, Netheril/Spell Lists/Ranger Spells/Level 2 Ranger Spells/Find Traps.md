# Find Traps
*Level 2 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the Alarm or Glyph of Warding spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.  
You learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense as well as its location.
