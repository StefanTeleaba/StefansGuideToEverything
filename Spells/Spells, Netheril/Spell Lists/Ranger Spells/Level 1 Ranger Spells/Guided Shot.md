# Guided Shot
*Level 1 Divination (Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 round

*With a guttural utterance made with unmoving lips, you magically focus your attention on a distant foe. Upon aiming your weapon, you note how clearly defined your intended target is.*

Until the end of your next turn, your ranged attacks with weapons ignore Half Cover and Three-Quarters Cover and attacking at long range doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with Ranged weapons.
