# Lay of the Land
*Level 1 Divination (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of lodestone)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You cast this spell and are surrounded with a nimbus of green light. In your mind, a map unfolds of the surrounding area, showing the cities, hamlets, and known ruins as if penned by a cartographer. The light fades but the knowledge of the map remains.*

You gain an overview of the area around you. Lay of the land gives basic information relevant to major landmarks, such as rivers, lakes, and settlements (of at least hamlet size). It indicates the direction and distance to each from the current location. You have a good understanding of the terrain up to 50 miles from your current location.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration of the spell increases by 10 minutes for each spell slot level above 1.
