You create an arc of lightning forming a 100-foot-long, 5-foot-wide Line between two targets you can see within range. A target can be a creature or an object. Each creature in the Line makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 5.
