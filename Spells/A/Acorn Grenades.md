## Acorn Grenades
*Homebrew*  
*Level 1 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

***Casting Time:*** Action  
***Range:*** Self  
***Components:*** V, S, M (acorns)  
***Duration:*** 1 minute

You touch up to 3 acorns and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged attack with one of the acorns by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, an acorn has a range of 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes fire damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the acorn.  
If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any acorns still affected by your previous casting.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage of each acorn increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 1.
