*Level 4 Transmutation (Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting or missing a target with a ranged attack using a weapon  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S

Immediately after hitting or missing the first target, the arrow then swerves and continues from that target to as many as three other targets of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of eachother. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by the arrow only once. You make a separate attack roll against each target.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The arrow can leap to one additional target for each spell slot level above 4.

# Doublestrike Arrow
*Transmutation*

**Level:** Ranger 4, justice of weald and woe 4  
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Casting Time:** 1 swift action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One arrow or bolt  
**Duration:** 1 round  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Spell Resistance:** No  

This spell is cast upon a single arrow or crossbow bolt, enabling it to strike two targets instead of one. The character firing the arrow selects the two targets, both of which must be within 30 feet of each other, and makes a separate attack roll against each target (using the same attack bonus). After striking or missing the first target, the arrow swerves and continues on course to the second target.

A doublestrike missile cannot hit the same target twice, and it is destroyed even if it misses its intended targets.

*Material Component:* Arrow or bolt.
