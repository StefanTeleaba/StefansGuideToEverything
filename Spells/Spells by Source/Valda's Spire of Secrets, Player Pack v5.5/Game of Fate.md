# Game of Fate
*Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a Gaming Set)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You magically compel a creature within range that can hear and understand you to a nonmagical game with vital consequences. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to join you in the game.  
The loser of the game takes 6d6 Psychic damage. If no player has won or lost by the end of the spell's duration, both you and the target take this damage. If you or one of your allies harms the target, you forfeit the game, and vice versa if the target or one of its allies harms you. Additionally, you and the target creature can negotiate for greater stakes. You can wager for higher Psychic damage (up to a maximum of 12d6), currency, property, or more esoteric rewards, such as bestowal of a noble title. The spell reveals if a creature attempts to place a bet it can't fulfill. A bet is finalized when you and the target agree on the bet, solidifying the bet with a handshake or similar gesture. Property or currency bet on the game is teleported to the winner at the game's conclusion. The loser is also magically compelled to take any action (such as bestowing a noble title) wagered as part of a bet.  
Lastly, no spell, magical effect, or creature other than you and the target can influence the game's outcome.
