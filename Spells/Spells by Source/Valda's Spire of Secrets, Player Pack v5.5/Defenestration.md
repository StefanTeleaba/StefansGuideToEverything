# Defenestration
*Level 2 Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of force erupts from your open hand, hurling a creature you can see within range through a window. The target makes a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is pushed up to 20 feet and thrown through a window of your choice. If there is no window within 20 feet of the target, it is instead pushed up to 20 feet in a direction of your choice and thrown through a window of arcane force, which materializes behind the creature and vanishes after it shatters. The target takes 4d6 Slashing damage and has the Prone condition when it is thrown through a window. On a successful save, the target is instead only pushed 10 feet and takes no damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 and the distance the target is pushed on a success or failure increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 2.
