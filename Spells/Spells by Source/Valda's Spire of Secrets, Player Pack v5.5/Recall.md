Record your location when you cast this spell. Until the end of your next turn, you can take a Reaction in response to an attack roll, a creature casting a spell, or a creature moving within 5 feet of you to teleport back to that location, or to the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. This teleportation precedes the triggering attack or spell. The spell then ends.
