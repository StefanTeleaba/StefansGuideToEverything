# Umbral Tendril
*Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a long tendril of life-stealing shadow that lashes out at a creature in range that you can see.  
Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit the target takes 2d8 Necrotic damage and you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the damage dealt.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.
