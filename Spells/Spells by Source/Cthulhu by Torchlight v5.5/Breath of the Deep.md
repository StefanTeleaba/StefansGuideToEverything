You conjure sea water from the deepest trench to surround a creature that you can see within range. The water seeps into the target's mouth and around its body, slowly crushing it with the unfathomable weight of the sea. The target takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage and is unable to talk for the duration or use the verbal components of spells.
