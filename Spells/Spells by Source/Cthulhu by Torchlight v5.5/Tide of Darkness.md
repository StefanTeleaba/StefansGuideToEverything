# Tide of Darkness
*Level 1 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 round

You unleash a wave of swirling shadows that fills an area next to you. Each creature in a 10-foot Cube of Darkness originating from you when you cast the spell makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 Psychic damage and is Blinded until it is no longer in the area of Darkness. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't Blinded. The Darkness lasts until the end of your next turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The size of the Cube increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
