You create a terrible force that slowly crushes the target from the inside. Choose a creature that you can see within range and roll 2d6 and record the total rolled. At the start of each of your turns, roll another 2d6 and add the number rolled to the total.  
If the total is greater than the target's Strength, it has Disadvantage on Strength-based attacks.  
If the total is greater than the target's Dexterity, its Speed is halved and attack rolls against it have Advantage.  
If the total is greater than its current Hit Points, the target immediately implodes and dies.
