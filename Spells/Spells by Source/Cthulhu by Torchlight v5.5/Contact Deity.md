# Contact Deity
*Level 5 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You contact a deity of the Cthulhu Mythos. You can ask the entity 1d6 questions that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. Old Ones aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the Old One's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the Old One's interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.  
When you cast this spell, roll a d20. If you roll a 1, the deity appears in the nearest unoccupied space and attacks creatures (including you) in the area for the spell's duration before returning to its realm.
