# Voorish Sign
*Level 3 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You have mastered the Voorish sign, a sigil from an ancient era said to predate the world's creation. Choose a creature that you can see within range. When you would normally roll one or more dice to deal damage to that creature with a spell, don't roll those dice for the damage; instead use the highest number possible for each die. In addition, you can choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action. You can cast that spell as part of casting Voorish Sign, expending spell slots for both.
