# Shadowy Eruption
*Level 3 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A 20-foot radius Sphere of gloom erupts from a point you choose within range as fell energies from the dimension of shadow flood the area. You select an entity to push through into this reality for a horrifying moment. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following options:  
**The Darkness Hides Terrors.** Creatures of your choice in the area must make Dexterity saving throws. A target takes 4d8 Psychic damage on a failed save and must use a reaction to move as far away as it can from the point you chose, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.  
**Tomb of Shadows.** Creatures of your choice in the area must make Constitution saving throws. A target takes 4d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save and its Speed is reduced by 20 feet. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.  
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
