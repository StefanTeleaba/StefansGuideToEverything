# Summon Shadow
*Level 5 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a spirit of shadow. It manifests as a silhouette of pure blackness in an unoccupied space you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Shadow Spirit stat block. When you cast this spell, choose Infiltrator or Assassin. Your choice determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.  
The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.
