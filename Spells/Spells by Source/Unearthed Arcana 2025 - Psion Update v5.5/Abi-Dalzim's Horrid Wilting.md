# Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
*Level 8 Necromancy (Psion, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of sponge)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 12d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Constructs automatically succeed at the save, and Plant creatures automatically fail the save.  
Nonmagical plants in the area that arenâ€™t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
