# Ectoplasmic Trail
*Level 2 Necromancy (Psion, Warlock)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You cloak yourself in spirits that leave ectoplasm in your wake until the end of your turn. While cloaked, you can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain, and moving doesnâ€™t provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you end your turn in such a space, you are returned to the last unoccupied space you were in.  
While cloaked, whenever you enter the space of a creature, the creature becomes covered in ectoplasm until the end of your next turn. A creature covered in ectoplasm has its Speed reduced by 10 feet and takes 2d8 Necrotic damage at the start of its turn. A creature can be covered in ectoplasm only once during a turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** While cloaked, your Speed increases by 10 feet for each spell slot level above 2.
