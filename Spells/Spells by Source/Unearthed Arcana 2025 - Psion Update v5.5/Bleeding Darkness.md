# Bleeding Darkness
*Level 3 Evocation (Psion, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of rare ink worth 50+ GP)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

You create an inky void in a 10-foot-radius Sphere at a point you can see above yourself within range.  
When you cast the spell, magical Darkness pours from the sphere, filling a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-tall Cylinder originating from the Sphere until the start of your next turn. The Cylinder is Difficult Terrain, and no light—magical or otherwise—can illuminate the area. When the Darkness appears, each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 Cold damage and have the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.  
Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to move the Sphere up to 20 feet horizontally and cause the Sphere to pour magical Darkness until the start of your next turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
