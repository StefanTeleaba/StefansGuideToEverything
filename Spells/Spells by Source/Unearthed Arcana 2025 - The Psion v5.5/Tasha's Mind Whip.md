You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 Psychic damage, and it canâ€™t make Opportunity Attacks until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
