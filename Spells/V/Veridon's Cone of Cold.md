*Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)

You unleash a blast of cold air. Each creature in a 60-foot Cone originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.
