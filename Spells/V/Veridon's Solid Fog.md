## Veridon's Solid Fog
*Level 4 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind of level 4 or higher) disperses it.  
A creature moving through that area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.  
Creatures in the area take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets inside the area are slowed to a halt and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.  
A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed and any damage taken from the fall is reduced by 1d6 for every 10 feet of fog it passes through.  

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The fog's radius increases by 10 feet for each spell slot level above 4.
