You unleash a roar of flames. Each creature in a 60-foot Cone originating from you makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
Flammable objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried start burning.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 5.
