## Tolodine's Acid Fog
*Level 6 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind of level 4 or higher) disperses it.  
For the duration, the fog turns the area into Difficult Terrain.  
Creatures in the area take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets inside the area are slowed to a halt and miss automatically. Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.  
A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed and any damage taken from the fall is reduced by 1d6 for every 10 feet of fog.  
Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 Acid damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.
