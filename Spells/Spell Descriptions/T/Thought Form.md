***Incorporeal Movement.*** You have a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover. You can move through occupied spaces as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn in such a space, you take 1d10 Force damage. If the spell ends in such a space, you are returned to the last unoccupied space you were in.  
***Psionic Recharge.*** As a Magic action, you can touch a creature (which can be yourself) and roll 1d6.

Once a creature regains a spell slot from this spell, that creature canâ€™t do so again until it finishes a Long Rest.
