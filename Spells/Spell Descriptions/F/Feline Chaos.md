Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration. An affected target takes 4d6 Slashing damage at the start of each of their turns, and they have Disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls. If they attempt to move, they must make a Constitution saving throw or gain the Prone condition, taking another 2d6 Slashing damage from the startled cats. At the end of their turn an affected creature makes another Dexterity saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage at the start of an affected target's turns increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.
