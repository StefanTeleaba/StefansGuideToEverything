# Phantom Panther
*Level 3 Conjuration (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a spectral panther that pounces on a creature you can see within range, mauling and pinning it for your allies close in for the kill.  
The target makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 8d6 Force damage and has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only, and the spell ends. While Restrained, the target takes 2d6 Force damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.
