# Vortex Warp
*Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You magically twist space around another creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or be teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The range of the spell increases by 30 feet for each spell slot level above 2.
