*Level 4 Transmutation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small servant's bell)  
**Duration:** Special

You touch a Medium or smaller Beast, which shape-shifts into a Humanoid with an appearance of your choice. The Beast's statistics are replaced by the stat block of a Commoner but retains its Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. You choose the Commoner's skill proficiency. The commoner wears Fine Clothes but has no other equipment, and has a basic understanding of all unskilled tasks.  
The target gains 10 Temporary Hit Points. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left. When the spell ends, the Fine Clothes dissipate into smoke.  
**Combat.** The commoner is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. It behaves as though it is dutifully employed by you.  
**Duration.** This spell's duration varies depending upon when and where it was cast. If cast in a location where time passes normally, the spell lasts until the twelfth stroke of the next midnight, however long that may be. Elsewhere, the spell lasts for 24 hours.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can shape-shift one additional Beast for each spell slot level above 4.
