When you cast this spell, you briefly stop time for everyone but yourself. You can take one additional action and move around in your space while no time passes for other creatures. That action can be used only to take the Search, Study, or Utilize action. Furthermore, you can't affect or damage any creature or object, other than objects you are wearing or carrying. If an object leaves your hand, it also becomes frozen in time.
