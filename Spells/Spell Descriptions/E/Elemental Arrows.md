# Elemental Arrows
*Level 3 Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a quiver and choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. Until the spell ends, arrows drawn from that quiver deal an extra 1d6 damage of the chosen type. The spell ends early if you cast it again or when all the arrows that were in the quiver when you cast the spell have been drawn.

***At Higher Levels.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for every two spell slot levels above 3.
