This spell allows the caster to copy non-magical text from one source onto blank sheets of paper or a blank book. The spell copies at a rate of 250 words per minute for the duration of the spell. If magical text is in the target of the spell the section is left blank in the copy. This spell triggers magical traps based on reading such as a glyph of warding.
