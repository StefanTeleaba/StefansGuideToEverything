# Rael's Enlarging Arrow
*Transmutation Cantrip (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S, M (a ranged weapon with the Ammunition property and that is worth 1+ CP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

Description: This spell enchants one arrow per 3 levels of caster (2 at 4th level, 3 at 7th etc). The arrow does not change when the spell is cast, but when it is shot by a bow, the effects of this spell become clear. The arrow then enlarges, growing 50% + 50% per 3 levels (100% at 4th level, 150% at 7th etc.). For every 50% the arrow grows, the damage is increased by one die. Thus if a flight arrow is used, the damage becomes 2d6 at 1st level, 3d6 at 4th, 4d6 at 7th etc. A sheaf arrow would add a die eight but is otherwise the same. The maximum damage caused by the spell is 5d The spell can affect d6 and d8 arrows but not d10.. After hitting a solid target the arrow is reverted to normal size. Anyone hit by an arrow enlarged by 100% or more must save vs. breath weapons or be knocked down.

The feeling of being shot on by one of these arrows is sort of like being fired up on with sharpened telephone poles, really scary! The material component is the arrow to be affected and a bit of powdered iron.
