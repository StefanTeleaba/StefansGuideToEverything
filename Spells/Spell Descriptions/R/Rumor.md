# Rumor
*Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You magically spread a rumor of 10 words or less in a 100-foot Emanation originating from you. Any creature within the Emanation that can hear and understand three or more other creatures believes that they hear the rumor being repeated by someone nearby. Different creatures hear the rumor from different people, so a concrete origin is impossible to discern. Generally, creatures won't become Hostile upon hearing even the most vicious rumors, but hearing a rumor can affect their attitude positively or negatively.
