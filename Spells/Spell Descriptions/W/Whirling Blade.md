# Whirling Blade 
*Level 1  Transmutation (Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a melee weapon with which you have proficiency and that is worth 1+ CP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl the weapon used in the spell's casting toward a creature within range. You make one attack with the weapon against that creature. The attack uses your spellcasting ability for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. The weapon reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses its last target.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The weapon leaps to one more creature of your choice within range for each spell slot level above 1. Make an attack roll against each target. A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
