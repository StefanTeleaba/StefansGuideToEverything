# Doublestrike Arrow
*Level 4 Transmutation (Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting or missing a target with a ranged attack using a weapon  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Immediately after hitting or missing the first target, the arrow then swerves and continues from that target to as many as three other targets of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of eachother. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by the arrow only once. You make a separate attack roll against each target.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The arrow can leap to one additional target for each spell slot level above 4.
