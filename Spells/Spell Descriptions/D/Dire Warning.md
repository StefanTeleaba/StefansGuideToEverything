# Dire Warning
*Level 4 Divination (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You receive a message of up to 6 words from yourself in the future, warning you of a critical threat or pointing you toward a fruitful avenue. The GM determines this message. At some point in the future, once you have learned why you sent the message, you must perform a ritual over the course of 10 minutes, which can be done during a Short or Long Rest, to deliver the message back in time to your past self. If you cast this spell and receive no message, it indicates that you will never complete the ritual in the future, possibly owing to your death or another hindrance.  
Once you cast this spell, you can't cast it again for 7 days or until you perform its ritual.
