*Homebrew*  
*Level 2 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

***Casting Time:*** Action  
***Range:*** 90 feet  
***Components:*** V, S, M (a feather, tuft of fur, and fish tail inside a gilded acorn worth 200+ GP)  
***Duration:*** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a bestial spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the **Bestial Spirit** stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature resembles an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or when the spell ends.  
The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
