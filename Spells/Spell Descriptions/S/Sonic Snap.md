*Evocation Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

*You bark the last word of the spell, and that word takes life, streaking toward your target and exploding in a shout.*

You create a brief but loud noise adjacent to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d6 Thunder damage and have the Deafened condition until the end of your next turn.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).
