# Scare
*Level 2 Necromancy (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bone from an undead creature)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must each make a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for the duration.  
A Frightened creature takes the Dash action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
