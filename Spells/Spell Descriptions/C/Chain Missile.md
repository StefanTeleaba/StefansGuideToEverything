## Chain Missile
*Level 3 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 600 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch four glowing darts of magical force toward a creature you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously. Each dart then leaps from that target to as many as four other creatures of your choice, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be targeted by only one of the darts.  

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell creates one more dart for each spell slot level above 3 and one additional dart leaps from the first target to another target for each spell slot level above 3.
