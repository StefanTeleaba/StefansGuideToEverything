# Call Deity
*Level 8 Conjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You can cast this spell only during the duration of a Contact Deity spell you also cast. You cause the deity you contacted to manifest in the nearest unoccupied space. For 1 hour, it acts as it wishes but treats you as an ally if you don't take actions against it. It doesn't extend this courtesy to your allies and interprets your attempts to protect others as acting against it.
