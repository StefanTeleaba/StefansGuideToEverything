You create a horrid illusion in the target's mind, convincing it that its body is slowly decaying. One creature that you can see in range is overcome with a sense of impending doom as it watches itself rot. Choose one of the following effects.  
A creature selflessly tries to prevent the disease from spreading to its allies. Whenever it starts its turn within 30 feet of an ally, it takes the Dash action and moves away from its nearest ally by the safest route unless there is nowhere to move.  
A creature becomes filled with spite as it tries to spread the disease to its enemies. It takes the Dash action and moves toward its nearest enemy by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. When an enemy is within 5 feet of it, it makes an Unarmed Strike against that target.
