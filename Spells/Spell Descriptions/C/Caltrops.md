# Caltrops
*Conjuration Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

*You speak the words and spread your palm open, as if you were throwing jacks. Coppery sparks spring from your palm, filling the corridor with small four-pronged spikes.*

This spell allows the caster to conjure magical caltrops in a 5ft-by-5ft area within range. These magical caltrops act as normal caltrops would for the duration of the spell.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The spell can affect an additional 5ft by 5ft square within range when you reach 5th level, 11th level, and 17th level.
