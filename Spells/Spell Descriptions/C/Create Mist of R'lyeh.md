R'lyeh is an ancient city cloaked in a horror-filled mist. You tap into that dreadful mist to create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Lightly Obscured. Strange, fleeting shapes are visible within it. A creature that ends its turn in the Sphere takes 1d4 Psychic damage. Beast creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or less refuse to enter the Sphere willingly.
