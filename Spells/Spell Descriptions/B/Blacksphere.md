# Blacksphere
*Level 8 Evocation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of charcoal and a small piece of onyx)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A burst of black force erupts at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d6 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after the explosion, an Invisible globe of force with a radius of up to 10 feet springs into existence at that point. The wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side).  
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by Dispel Magic. A Disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane and blocks ethereal travel through the wall.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 4d6 for each spell slot level above 8.
