# Body Warping of Gorgoroth
*Level 1 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Choose a Humanoid of your size that you can see in range. You physically transform to become an exact duplicate of that creature for the duration. Even a thorough physical examination fails to find any differences between you and the target.  
Your voice and equipment don't change.
