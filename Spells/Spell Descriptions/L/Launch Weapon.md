# Launch Weapon
*Evocation Cantrip (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S, M (a Dagger or Dart that is worth 1+ CP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You make one ranged attack with the weapon used in the spell's casting. The attack uses your spellcasting ability for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** Whether you deal Force damage or the weapon's normal damage type, the attack deals extra Force damage when you reach levels 5 (2d4), 11 (4d4), and 17 (6d4).
