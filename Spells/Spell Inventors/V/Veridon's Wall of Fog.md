*Level 1 Evocation (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of split dried peas)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of fog at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 40 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The length of the wall increases by 20 feet and the height increases by 10 feet, or the radius of the wall increases by 10 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
