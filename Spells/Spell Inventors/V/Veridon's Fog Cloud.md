## Veridon's Fog Cloud
*Level 1 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
