## Primidon's Incendiary Cloud
*Level 8 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud's area is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.  
When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space. A creature makes this save only once per turn. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there.  
The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.  

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The cloud's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 8.
