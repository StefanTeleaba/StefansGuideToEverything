*Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (three glass beads)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

You create a Small hand of shimmering magical energy in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the duration, and it moves at your command. The hand appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the hand. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.  
As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can move the hand up to 30 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 2.
