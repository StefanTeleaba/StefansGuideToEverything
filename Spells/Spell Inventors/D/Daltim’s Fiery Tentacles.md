## Daltimâ€™s Fiery Tentacles
*Level 5 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a tentacle)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles lined in blue fire fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into Difficult Terrain.  
Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 Fire damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.  
A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Fire damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 5.
