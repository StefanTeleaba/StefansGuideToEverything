*Level 3 Transmutation (Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting or missing a target with a ranged attack using a weapon  
**Range:** Self

When you cast the spell, the weapon or ammunition you're using transforms into a lightning bolt. The damage of the weapon or ammunition for this attack is 4d8 Lightning. The target takes half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form. 

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
