Level 1 Divination (Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its speeds.  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

*The bow in your hand feels more like an extension of your body as you complete the spell — as if it’s become a part of your arm. Creatures nearby seem sharper to your eyes, more in focus.*

When you cast the spell, you can make one ranged attack against the provoking creature. For the duration, when a creature would provoke an Opportunity Attack, you can take a Reaction to make one ranged attack against that creature. In addition, you do not have Disadvantage on ranged attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of an enemy.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration of the spell increases by 1 minute for each spell slot level above 1.
