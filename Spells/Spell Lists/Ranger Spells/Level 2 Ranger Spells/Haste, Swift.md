*Two quick syllables release the power of the spell, and the world moves a bit slower about you.*

Until the end of your next turn, your Speed is doubled, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, you have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used to take only the Attack (one attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Utilize action.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration of the spell increases by 1 round for each spell slot level above 2.
