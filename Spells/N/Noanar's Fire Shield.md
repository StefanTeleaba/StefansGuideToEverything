## Noanar's Fire Shield
*Level 4 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet.  
The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you Resistance to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you Resistance to Fire damage.  
In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 Fire damage from a warm shield or 2d8 Cold damage from a chill shield.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for every two spell slot levels above 4.
