You unleash a blast of high pitched sound. One creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d8 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.
