***Casting Time:*** Action  
***Range:*** 30 feet  
***Components:*** V, S, M (a hollow cone of brass and gold worth 50+ GP)  
***Duration:*** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a blast of powerful sound forming a 30-foot Cone originating from you. Each creature in the Cone makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Cone moves into its space and when it enters the Cone or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn. Creatures have the Deafened condition while entirely inside the Cone.  
Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to maintain and reposition the Cone.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.
