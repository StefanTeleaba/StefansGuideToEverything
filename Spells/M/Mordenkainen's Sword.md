## Mordenkainen's Sword
*Homebrew*  
*Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Wizard)*

***Casting Time:*** Bonus Action  
***Range:*** 90 feet  
***Components:*** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)  
***Duration:*** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.  
When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. This attack scores a Critical Hit if the number on the d20 is 18 or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total of 12d12 force damage).  
On your later turns, you can take a Bonus Action to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** When you cast this spell with a level 9 spell slot, the sword can attack twice.
