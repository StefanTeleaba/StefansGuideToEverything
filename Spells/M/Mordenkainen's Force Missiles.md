You create two powerful missiles of magical force. Each missile strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A missile deals 4d6 Force damage to its target. The missile then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take half as much damage. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional missile for every two spell slot levels above 4.
