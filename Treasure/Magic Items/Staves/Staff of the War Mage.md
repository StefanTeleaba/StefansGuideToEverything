*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Sorcerer or Wizard)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws and spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore Half Cover when making a spell attack roll.

***Spells.*** The staff has 20 charges. While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.
