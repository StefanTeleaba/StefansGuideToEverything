# Ilbratha
*Weapon (Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

*Ilbratha was a bronze short sword and despite many battles, it retained a sharp edge. It had a slightly leaf-shaped blade, a short but ornate cross-guard, and a green hilt. Most distinctively, the blade was inlaid with six matching bloodstones in its fuller, on the left face. Although it was a magical weapon, the sword did not glow and it carried no inscription. Its leaping ability made it seem surprisingly light, as if it sought to spring away.*
