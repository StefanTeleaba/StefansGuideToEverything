# Gold

While most use gold as a currency, spellcasters know of gold's magical properties. When magically refined and treated, gold can be made as hard as steel. The following information refers to magically treated gold.

Armor made from treated gold grants acid and fire resistance 2. Gold armors are one category heavier than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations (for example, whether a barbarian can use his fast movement ability while wearing the armor or not). Light armors are treated as medium, and medium and heavy armors are treated as heavy. Spell failure chances for armor and shields made from gold are increased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is decreased by 2 (which may bring it below 0), and armor check penalties are increased by 3.

Gold weapons are considered heavy weapons (see the sidebar on Heavy Weapons).

Magically treated gold weighs twice as much as steel, has hardness 10, and has 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
