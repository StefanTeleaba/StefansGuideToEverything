**Weapon.**

*Magic of Faerun, p.178*

Thts bone-white metal, sometimes known as icesteel can take a high polish and is often mistaken for ivory when seen in finished items, but has a distinctive greenish sheeu in candlelight. Dlarun ore is found in the clay dug from riverbanks, and when first  refined it is soft and easily carved. A second heating makes it hard and durable. This property makes the metal ideal for decorative work and figurines.

Armor made from dlarun grants fire resistance 2. Weapons forged of dlarun inflict +1 point of frost damage each time they hit (this is cumulative wirh other abilities, such as frost or icy burst). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected. (A longsword or a suit of chainmail is affected, while a spear or a suit of studded leather is not.) Dlarun can never be used in a magic item that uses fire effects, such as a flaming or flamuig burst weapon.

Dlarun weighs the same as steel, has hardness 10, and has 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
Market Price Modifier: Armor +2,000 gp; weapon +1,5OO gp.

This bone-white metal can take a high polish and is often mistaken for ivory when seen in finished items, but it has a distinctive greenish sheen in candlelight and when in the presence of magical radiances. Dlarun is a little-known metal of the halflings, who take care to keep word of it as paltry and as inaccurate as possible. Dlarun is usually encountered after having been formed by halflings into small figurines, inlay plates, or knobs and pommels shaped like beast claws, acorns, or other elements of nature.

Derived from roasting clay dug from the banks of certain rivers, dlarun is first gathered as white chips among fire ash that are then melted in a hot crucible that is filled with a secret mixture of liquids. A lump of soft, soaplike metal results that can be readily carved by anyone with a sharp knife. When the desired end result has been achieved, a second heatingin the open flames of a fire fueled and supplemented by secret ingredients, this timetransforms the metal into lightweight rigidity. It is thus ideal for item adornment and has the added property of steadying the mind of any being in direct (bare flesh) contact with it, allowing them to make all saving throws vs. enchantment/charm and illusion/phantasm spells (and similar psionic or spell-like power effects) at a +1 bonus.

Items made primarily of arandur automatically succeed in all item saving throws vs. fall, normal fire, cold, and electricity. They receive a +1 bonus to all item saving throws vs. acid, crushing blow, disintegration, magical fire, and lightning.
