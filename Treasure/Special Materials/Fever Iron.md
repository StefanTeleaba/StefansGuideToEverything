# Fever Iron

In some volcanic craters, pools of molten
metal collect and are never allowed to fully cool. Some- times these pools of semisolid metal attract the raw energy of the Weave and are transformed into what the dwarves call fever iron. Fever iron can be made fully solid through a magical process that includes applica- tion of intense cold, after which it can be worked like normal iron.
Armor made from fever iron grants fire resistance 2. Weapons forged of fever iron inflict +1 point of fire damage each time they hit (this is cumulative with other abilities, such as flaming or flaming burst). Items not pri- marily of metal are not meaningfully affected. (A long- sword or a suit of chainmail is affected, while a spear or a suit of studded leather is not.) Fever iron can never be used in a magic item that uses cold effects, such as a frost or icy burst weapon.
Fever iron weighs the same as steel, has hardness 12, and has 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
