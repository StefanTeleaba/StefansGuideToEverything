# Special Materials
In addition to magic items created with spells, some substances have innate special properties.

While only a few such materials are presented here, other special materials may exist in a given campaign.

If you make a suit of armor or weapon out of more than one special material, you get the benefit of only the most prevalent material. For example, full plate made of both adamantine and mithral will either provide damage reduction or lower weight, not both. However, you can build a double weapon with each head made of a different special material. A dire flail, for example, could have an alchemical silver head for fighting lycanthropes and a cold iron head for fighting fey.

## Special Weapon Materials, Behind the Curtain
Each of the special materials described in this section has a definite
game effect. Some creatures, such as fey, have damage reduction
based on their creature type or core concept. Some are resistant to all
but a special type of damage, such as that dealt by evil-aligned
weapons or bludgeoning weapons. Others are vulnerable to weapons
of a particular material. Fey tend to be susceptible to cold iron.
Combating golems is best done with adamantine weapons.
Characters may choose to carry several different types of weapons,
depending upon the campaign and types of creatures they most
commonly encounter. Some may use silversheen, described on page
266, designed to temporarily add the property of alchemical silver to a
weapon. Its cost was carefully considered so as not to let silversheen
overshadow weapons actually containing alchemical silver. You’ll also
notice that cold ironsheen is not mentioned. This is intentional. Cold
iron’s core attribute is its resistance to magic. Making a magic item
that mimics this attribute undermines its concept.
