# Platinum, Alchemical

*3.5e*

This silvery-white metal superficially resembles aluminium but is extremely heavy. Because it is so malleable, it must be magically altered to the rigidity of steel so it can maintain its shape even when used in combat. This process also catalyzes its magical properties. The following information refers to magically treated platinum.

Armor made from treated platinum grants cold and sonic resistance 2. Platinum armors are one category heavier than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations (for example, whether a barbarian can use his fast movement ability while wearing the armor or not). Light armors are treated as medium, and medium and heavy armors are treated as heavy. Spell failure chances for armor and shields made from platinum are increased by 10%, the maximum Dexterity bonus is decreased by 2 (which may bring it below 0), and armor check penalties are increased by 3. Armor not primarily of metal is not meaningfully affected. (A suit of chainmail is affected, while a suit of studded leather is not.)

Platinum weapons are considered heavy weapons (see the Heavy Weapons sidebar).

Magically treated platinum weighs twice as much as steel, has hardness 10, and has 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
