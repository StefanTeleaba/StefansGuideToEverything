Darksteel is silvery in hue when polished or cut, but its exposed surfaces have a deep, gleaming purple luster. The process for making this type of steel was once lost, but has been recently rediscovered thanks to some ancient dwarven texts. The alloy is made from meteoric iron tempered with a variety of special oils.

Armor made from darksteel grants acid resistance 2. Weapons forged of darksteel inflict +1 point of electricity damage each time they hit (this is cumulative with other abilities, such as shock or shocking burst). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected. (A longsword or a suit of chainmail is affected, while a spear or a suit of studded leather is not.)

Darksteel weighs the same as steel, has hardness 10, and has 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
Market Price Modifier: Armor +2,000 gp; weapon +1,500 gp.
