# Adamantine

Found only in meteorites and the rarest of veins in magical areas, this ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or
suit of armor.

Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking
objects, ignoring hardness less than 20.

Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer damage reduction of 1/– if it’s light armor, 2/– if it’s medium armor, and 3/– if it’s heavy armor.

Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of masterwork quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below. Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls, and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type.

Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine. An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not. Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine.

Weapons, armor and shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal; for instance, an adamantine greatsword has 13 hit points instead of the normal 10 for steel. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

| Type of Adamantine Item | Item Cost Modifier |
|-------------------------|-------------------:|
| Ammunition              | +60 GP             |
| Shield                  | +2,000 GP          |
| Light armor             | +5,000 GP          |
| Medium armor            | +10,000 GP         |
| Heavy armor             | +15,000 GP         |
| Weapon                  | +3,000 GP          |
