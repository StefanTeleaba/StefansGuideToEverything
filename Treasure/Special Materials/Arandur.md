# Arandur

Arandur is a rare natural metal found in igneous rock, usually as streaks of blue-green ore amid vitreous glass. When refined and forged, the metal is silver-blue with a green reflective shine. It is famous for holding a sharp edge even when abused and is the favored material for making keen weapons.

Armor made from arandur grants sonic resistance 2. Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected. (A suit of chainmail is affected, while a suit of studded leather is not.)

Arandur weighs the same as steel, has hardness 12, and has 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
