# Staff of Transportation
*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Sorcerer or Wizard)*

*This is a hollow wire staff with a mottled brown uncut gem at each end.*

***Spells.*** The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

| Spell          | Charge Cost |
|----------------|:-----------:|
| Blink          | 3           |
| Dimension Door | 4           |
| Misty Step     | 2           |
| Teleport       | 7           |

***Regaining Charges.*** The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff is destroyed and lost forever.
