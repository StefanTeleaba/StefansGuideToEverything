***Arachnid Rod.*** 
Three times per day, you can shoot forth
sticky webbing as a ranged touch attack
out to a range of 60 feet. Targets struck
are entangled and must succeed on a
DC 20 Escape Artist check to wriggle
free or a DC 24 Strength check to
break through the sticky bindings. As
with webs created by the web spell, this
webbing is extremely fl ammable: It is
burned away after taking 10 points of
fi re damage.
As one or more of your uses per day,
you can shoot a sticky strand of webbing
out to a range of 120 feet. The strand
remains attached to the end of the rod
until you the release it (a move action).
You can cause the rod to reel in the strand
(a standard action) at a rate of 10 feet per
round. The strand is strong enough to
bear up to 500 pounds of weight, so if you
fi re the strand at a ledge overhead, you
can reel in the strand, lifting you toward
the ledge at a rate of 10 feet per round.
If this function is used against a creature,
you must succeed on a ranged touch
attack. The creature can break free of the
strand by attacking it (hardness 5, hp 10),
burning it (as above), or succeeding on a
DC 24 Strength check to break free. If
you reel in the creature, it must succeed
on a DC 24 Strength check or be pulled
forward. If the Strength check fails by
5 or more, the target falls prone.
