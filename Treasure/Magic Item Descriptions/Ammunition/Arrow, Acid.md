# Acid Arrow
*Ammunition, Rare*

This Arrow deals an additional 1d6 Acid damage. As you hit the creature, this arrow creates a spray of acid. The target of the attack and each creature within 15 feet of it make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 Acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Found in caches of 1d6, these +1 oddities are
highly valued. They transform themselves into a
spray of acid when fired, doing 2d6 points of
damage to the target, and soaking everything
within 15 feet of the point of impact with acid
(items must save vs. acid or be destroyed).
