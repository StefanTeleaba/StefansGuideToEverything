***Ring of Resolve.*** 
A ring of resolve grants you a +4 morale
bonus on Will saves made against spells
and spell-like effects with the fear
descriptor. This is a continuous effect
and requires no activation.
Once per day, as an immediate action
you can turn back a fear spell or spelllike
effect against the original caster as
long as that effect had you as the target.
For all aspects of the spell, the effect
functions as if the original caster had
selected itself as the target.
