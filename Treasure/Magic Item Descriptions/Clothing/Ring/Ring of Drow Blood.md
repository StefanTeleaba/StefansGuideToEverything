***Ring of Drow Blood.*** 
A ring of drow blood grants you the ability
to use dancing lights, darkness, and faerie
fire as spell-like abilities, each once per
day. If you already have the ability to use
these spells as spell-like abilities, you
gain an additional daily use for each at
your normal caster level.
