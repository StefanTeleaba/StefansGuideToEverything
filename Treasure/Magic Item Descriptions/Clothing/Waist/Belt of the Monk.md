# Belt of the Monk
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You gain the following benefits while you are wearing this belt and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield.
***Martial Arts Die.*** You can roll 1d8 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike.  
***Dexterous Attacks.*** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.  
***Unarmored Defense.*** While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

*If Attuned by a Monk:*  
***Martial Arts Die.*** Your Martial Arts Die changes as if you were a monk of five levels higher. If Your Martial Arts Die is 1d12, it changes to 2d8.  
***Unarmored Defense.*** While wearing this belt, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class if you are wearing no armor and using no Shield.

This simple rope belt, when wrapped around a character’s waist, confers great ability in unarmed combat. The wearer’s AC and unarmed damage is treated as a monk of five levels higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat, the belt lets her make one additional stunning attack per day. If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed damage of a 5th-level monk. This AC bonus functions just like the monk’s AC bonus.
