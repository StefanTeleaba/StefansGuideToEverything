***Belt of the Reinforced Form.*** 
While you wear a belt of the reinforced
form, whenever you are the target of a
transmutation spell or spell-like effect,
or some other transformative effect
such as an aboleth’s slime or a basilisk’s
petrifying gaze, you gain a +4 bonus on
your saving throw.
In addition, once per day, when casting
a transmutation spell with a casting
time of 1 standard action on yourself,
you can cast that spell as a swift action
instead.
