# Belt of the Serpent
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

***Serpentine Might.*** You gain a +2 bonus to your Strength and Dexterity scores.  
***Poison Resilience.*** You gain a +5 bonus to saving throws you make to avoid or end the Poisoned condition.  
***Escape Artist.*** You gain a +5 bonus to saving throws you make to avoid being grappled and to checks you make to escape a grapple.  
***Serpent Form.***  
You can command the belt (no action required) to become a Giant Constrictor Snake (Gargantuan Beast, 180 HP) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours.  
On your turn, you can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.  
You can command the snake (no action required) to revert to belt form in its current space, and you can't use this property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its belt form; the belt then crumbles and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to belt form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.
