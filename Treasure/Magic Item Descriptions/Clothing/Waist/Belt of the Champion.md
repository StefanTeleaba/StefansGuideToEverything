This belt is forged of thick golden links, each
set with a cabochon-cut semiprecious stone. Its
large, oval buckle is embossed with the closed
fi st of Kord.
These gem-studded belts are sacred to followers
of Kord, the god of strength. When
you wear one of these items, it functions
as a belt of giant strength +2 if you
are chaotic good, neutral good,
or chaotic neutral. All of Kord’s
followers vie for the honor of winning
one of these items, and each belt
is passed down through generations of
his faithful.
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection, you gain
a +5 competence bonus on Strength
checks and a +4 morale bonus on saves
against fear effects while wearing a belt of
the champion. If you ever fail a save against
a fear effect while wearing this belt, its
relic power is negated for 1 hour.
To use the relic power, you must worship
Kord and either sacrifi ce a 3rd-level
divine spell slot or have the True Believer
feat and at least 5 HD.
Lore: The fi rst belt of the champion was
forged by a priest of Kord in a tiny village
for a traveling hero who, having failed
to persuade the villagers to fl ee before a
horde of orcs, offered to stay and defend
them. Each decade since then, Kord has
given one of these belts to a favorite follower
(Knowledge [religion] DC 20).
