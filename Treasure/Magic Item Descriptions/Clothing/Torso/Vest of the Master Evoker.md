Crackling with power, a vest of the master evoker intensifies arcane evocation spells you cast. Many an ambitious evoker sees gaining this vest as a rite of passage, much like casting his first magic missile or fireball, and among elite warmages (CAr 10) it serves as an unparalleled status symbol.

Three times per day, you can activate the vest to enhance the next arcane evocation spell you cast before the end of your turn. That spell deals additional damage equal to twice its spell level, and the save DC of the spell increases by 2. This damage is of the same type as normal for the spell (or, if the spell deals more than one type of damage, of any one of those types at your discretion). If the spell doesn’t normally deal damage, this use of the vest has no effect.

In addition, you can apply the effect of any sudden metamagic feat (CAr 83) you know to any evocation spell you cast from a wand or staff as if you were casting the spell yourself. Doing this requires no activation, but uses up that feat’s daily use as normal.

You gain these benefits while wearing the vest.  
***Enhanced Evocation.*** This vest has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the vest, you can expend a charge as a Bonus action to activate it. The next Evocation spell you cast until the end of your turn deals additional damage equal to twice the level of the expended spell slot and the spell save DC for that spell increases by 2.  
***Enhanced Metamagic.*** You can use Metamagic Options you know when casting spells from a wand or staff.
