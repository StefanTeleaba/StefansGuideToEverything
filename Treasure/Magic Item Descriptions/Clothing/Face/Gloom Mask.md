***Gloom Mask.*** 
Three times per day, you gain the ability
to see in darkness out to 30 feet. This
sight penetrates all forms of darkness,
even that created by a deeper darkness
spell; the effect lasts for 5 rounds.
In addition, three times per day, any
spell or spell-like ability up to 3rd level
with the darkness descriptor that you
cast functions as if you had cast it with
the Widen Spell metamagic feat.
