# Boots of Haste
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

While you wear these boots, you can take a Bonus Action to click the boots' heels together. If you do, your Speed is doubled, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, you have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used to take only the Attack (one attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Utilize action. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a Long Rest.
