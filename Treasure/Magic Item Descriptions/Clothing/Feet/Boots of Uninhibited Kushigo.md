# Boots of Uninhibited Kushigo
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

*During a hilltop battle that soaked the slopes in gore, Kushigo's best friend Irishi was scalped before he could help her. The enemy held up the bloody wig, and Kushigo fell upon one, and then another, until he had killed so many that they hung from his antlered shoulders like skewered effigies.*

***Experienced and Deadly.*** You can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes.
