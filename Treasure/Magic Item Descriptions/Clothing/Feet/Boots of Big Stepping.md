# Boots of Big Stepping
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

*These wolfhide boots are secured with leather thongs that wrap twice about the ankle. The fur is exceptionally soft and has a faint sheen that makes the boots appear to shimmer in the light. The spirit of a blink dog has been harnessed within these boots.*

***Teleport.*** 3/Day: You can teleport up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
