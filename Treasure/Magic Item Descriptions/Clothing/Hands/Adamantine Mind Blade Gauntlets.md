Each of these heavy leather gloves bears a violet
crystal set on a small plate of adamantine.
Adamantine mind blade gauntlets allow you
to give your mind blade the properties of
adamantine. If you are able to enhance
your mind blade (with the mind blade
enhancement class feature), whenever
you materialize your mind blade while
wearing these gauntlets, you can choose
to treat it as an adamantine weapon for the
purpose of ignoring hardness or overcoming
damage reduction. This ability takes
the place of a property with a +1 enhancement
bonus value.
For example, a 6th-level soulknife
wearing the gauntlets could either choose
to apply the gauntlets’ effect or apply
one of the +1 enhancement bonus value
properties given on the table (EPH 29). A
10th-level soulknife could apply both the
gauntlets’ effect and a +1 enhancement
bonus value property rather than applying
a combination of properties from the
table totaling +2.
Adamantine mind blade gauntlets function
an unlimited number of times per
day. The gauntlets require no separate
activation; using them is part of the action
to materialize your mind blade.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, fabricate,
mind blade.
