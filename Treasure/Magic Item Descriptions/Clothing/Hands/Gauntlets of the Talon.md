These elegant gauntlets are made of a silvery
metal and have a scaly surface. Each fi nger is
tipped with a long talon made of sapphire.
Provided that you are lawful good, lawful
neutral, or neutral good, gauntlets of the
talon grant you two primary natural claw
attacks that count as magic weapons
for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction. Each claw deals 1d6 points of
slashing damage (if you are Medium).
Relic Power: If you have established
the proper divine connection and already
have levels in the monk class, you are
treated as if you were a monk of fi ve
levels higher than you actually are for the
purposes of AC, unarmed damage, and
the ki strike ability. This benefi t doesn’t
stack with similar benefi ts (such as from
a monk’s belt). Also, you can treat your
unarmed damage as either bludgeoning
or slashing damage (chosen each time
you attack).
To use the relic power, you must
worship Bahamut and either sacrifi ce
a 3rd-level divine spell slot or have the
True Believer feat and at least 5 HD. If
you sacrifi ce a 5th-level divine spell slot
or have the True Believer feat and at least
9 HD, the gauntlets also function as ghost
touch weapons for the purpose of attacking
incorporeal creatures. In addition, you
gain a +4 bonus on grapple checks.
Lore: It is said that this silvery set
of gauntlets was fashioned by Bahamut
himself, then given to the master of a
now-defunct order of monks (Knowledge
[religion] DC 15).
Members of the order’s inner circle
eventually discovered the secret of their
manufacture, but they managed to make
only a few additional sets before their
order was destroyed by followers of Tiamat
(Knowledge [religion] DC 20).
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
