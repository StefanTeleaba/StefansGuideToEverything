This winged mithral helm shines in the light
like a priceless heirloom.
An angelhelm allows a good-aligned
wearer to emulate certain traits of celestial
beings. Your melee attacks are treated as
good-aligned weapons for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction. This
is a continuous effect and requires no
activation.
In addition, your angelhelm allows
you to use cure critical wounds, dispel evil
(DC 17), and resist energy (acid or cold
only) as spell-like abilities each once
per day.
The helm grants no benefi t to nongood
wearers.
Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,
dispel evil, cure critical wounds, resist energy,
good alignment.
Cost to Create: 5,000 gp, 400 XP,
