# Crown of the North Wind
A crown of the north wind is the traditional headgear of a humanoid servitor of Bahamut. In the past year, individual dragonborn have begun to receive visions leading them to the lair of a chromatic dragon whose hoard contains one of these ancient relics.  
**Lore:** Characters can gain the following pieces of information about crowns of the north wind by making Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history) checks.  
*DC 15:* Bahamut, the Lord of the North Wind, has traditionally rewarded his greatest dragonborn knights with such crowns, allowing them to lead small groups of adventurers into battle with the spawn of Tiamat.  
*DC 25:* Unlike the Dragon Queen, Bahamut rewards metallic dragons for their discretion and mercy by giving them less destructive alternatives to their traditional energy breath weapons. A crown of the north wind grants the bearer similar alternatives.  
*DC 35:* The elven Parwiccan Cycle speaks of dragonborn wearing such crowns during the Time of Dragons. It is apparently Bahamut’s will that such crowns have begun reappearing in the Realms, although it is unclear whether they are new creations or truly ancient relics forged millennia ago.  
**Description:** A crown of the north wind is an elegant platinum crown with five spires, each one shaped like a different metallic dragon (brass, copper, bronze, gold, and silver).  
**Effect:** A crown of the north wind provides a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma and radiates a continuous cloak of bravery effect when worn. (The latter effect can be consciously dismissed or resumed as a standard action.)  
If the crown-wearer has an energy breath weapon (acid, cold, fire, or lightning), the crown allows the wearer to substitute the secondary breath weapon of a metallic dragon, as follows:
| Cone or Line of: | Becomes a Cone of:                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Acid             | Slow gas (as copper)                        |
| Cold             | Paralyzing gas (as silver)                  |
| Fire             | Sleep (as brass) or weakening gas (as gold) |
| Lightning        | Repulsion gas (as bronze)                   |

For effects that depend on the age category of the breather, use the wearer’s age category (if he or she has one) or assume an age category of young, whichever is more favorable to the wearer. If a creature can choose among energy types for his breath weapon, then he can also choose among substitution effects.
