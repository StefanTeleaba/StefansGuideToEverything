# Platinum Helm
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  

*This scaled metal helm covers the entire face. A pair of large, fully spread dragon wings is attached at the temples.*

*Worn by a Creature of Lawful Good, Neutral Good or Lawful Neutral Alignment:*  
***Frightened Immunity.*** You have Immunity to the Frightened condition.

*Worn by a Follower of Bahamut of Level 9+:*  
***Intimidating Presence.*** When you take the Attack action, you can strike terror into others. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 60-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can't use this ability again until the next dawn, unless you expend a use of your Channel Divinity (no action required) to use it again.

*Worn by a Follower of Bahamut of Level 15+:*  
***Blindsense.*** You gain Blindsense with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Blindsense when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

A platinum helm imbues you with the essence of Bahamut, lord of the good dragons. While wearing it, you are immune to the frightful presence of evil dragons if you are lawful good, neutral good, or lawful neutral.  
**Relic Power:** If you have established the proper divine connection, you can activate the helm as you make an attack to create a frightful presence effect. When you do so, each foe within 60 feet of you must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Cha modifier) or be panicked (if it has 4 or fewer HD) or shaken (if it has 5 or more HD) for 4d6 rounds. This ability functions three times per day.  
To use the relic power, you must worship Bahamut and either sacrifice a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD. If you sacrifi ce an 8th-level spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 15 Hit Dice, you can command the helm once per day to grant you blindsense with a 60-foot range for 1 hour.  
**Lore:** The seven original platinum helms were given to the gold dragons that served as Bahamutâ€™s consorts. In the centuries since, they have passed to his servants on the Material Plane (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).
