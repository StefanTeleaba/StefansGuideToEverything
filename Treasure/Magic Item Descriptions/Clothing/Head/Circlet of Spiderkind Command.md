***Circlet of Spiderkind Command.*** 
Three times per day, a circlet of spiderkind
command allows you to issue psychic
commands to spiderkind creatures (see
page 112). As a standard action, you
can target a single spiderkind creature
within 30 feet. The target is entitled to a
DC 14 Will save to resist the command.
If it fails, you can direct it to perform
simple commands such as “attack,” “run,”
and “fetch.” If the spiderkind creature
has the mindless special quality, you can
order it to make suicidal or self-destructive
commands.
Once you establish control, you can
direct it with silent mental commands
as long as you can see the affected creature.
Changing a command is a move
action.
As a daily use of this item, you can
also cast giant vermin on any single
spider within range.
