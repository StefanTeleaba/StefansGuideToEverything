# The Pointy Hat
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)*

*Sages over the course of ages have dealt very constructive and useful advice - however, none so sagacious as that of the wizard Otiluke, who once advised one of his students thusly: 'Never cast Speak with Dead on a loved one if there's unresolved tension there. It's never worth it. Trust me.'*

***Glorious Pointy Hat.*** You gain a bonus to your Charisma (Persuasion) checks equal to your Intelligence modifier.
