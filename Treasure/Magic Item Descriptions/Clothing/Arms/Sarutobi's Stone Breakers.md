# Sarutobi's Stone Breakers
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  

While wearing these bracers, you have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with your Unarmed Strikes. Those strikes deal your choice of Force damage or their normal damage type. When you score a Critical Hit with your Unarmed Strikes, you deal two additional dice of damage.
