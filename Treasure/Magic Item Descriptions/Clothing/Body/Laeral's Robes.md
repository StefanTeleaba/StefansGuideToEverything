# Laeral's Robes
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*  
*Weight: 1 lb.*  

*Fashioned and worn by Laeral Arunsun, these rich robes are adorned with scores of magical, eyelike patterns, visible only when the robes are worn.*

*Robe of Eyes.*  
***All-Around Vision.*** The robe gives you Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  
***Special Senses.*** You have Darkvision and Truesight, both with a range of 120 feet.  
***Drawbacks.*** A Light spell cast on the robe or a Daylight spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the Blinded condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for Light or DC 15 for Daylight), ending the condition on yourself on a success.

*Cloak of Resistance.*  
***Resistance.*** You gain a +5 bonus to saving throws while you wear these robes.  

*Heward's Handy Pockets.*  
These robes have 6 pockets, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each pocket can hold up to 200 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet. The robes always weigh 1 pound, regardless of their contents.  
Retrieving an item from the robes requires a Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When you reach into the robes for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.
