# Armor of Uninhibited Kushigo
*Wondrous Item, Rare*  
*Weight: 3 lb.*  

*Long ago, Kushigo was a warrior. Bedecked in an enormous set of plate steel, its shoulder pauldrons fashioned like great antlered stags, his arrival on a battlefield spelled doom for the enemy. Yet this armour - so light and fine - speaks nothing to the legacy.*
