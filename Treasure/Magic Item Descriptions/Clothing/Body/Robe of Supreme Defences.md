# Robe of Supreme Defences
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*  
*Weight: 3 lb.*  

*Long ago, the young wizard Bigby noticed his friend Tenser spending a lot of time with his robe. One of nature's pranksters, Bigby sent his dog, Bigboy, to savage the garment. The ensuing struggle between canine and nude wizard was brutal, and eventually led to Tenser designing more durable robes like this one.*
