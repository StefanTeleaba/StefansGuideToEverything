# Cindermoth Cloak
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*  
*Weight: 1 lb.*  

*With every rustle of this cloak, small moths like windblown embers appear around you - they flutter for a moment, then fade into inconsequence.*

***Flaming Shroud.*** If a creature hits you with a melee attack roll, the creature starts Burning.
