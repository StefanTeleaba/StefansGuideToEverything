***Assassin's Cloak.*** 
Three times per day, whenever you
speak the command word, the assassinâ€™s
cloak diminishes your presence, making
you seem insignifi cant and unimportant.
You gain a +10 competence bonus
on Hide checks, and creatures must
succeed on a DC 17 Will save to attack
you. Those who succeed can attack you
normally. This effect lasts 10 rounds or
until you make an attack (as invisibility,
PH 245), whichever comes first.
