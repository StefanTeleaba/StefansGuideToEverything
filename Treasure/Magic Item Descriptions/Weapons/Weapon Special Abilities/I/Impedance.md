***Impedance.*** When you hit a creature with this weapon, the target's ability to cast spells is impeded until the end of your next turn. If the creature tries to cast a spell it must first make an ability check using its spellcasting ability (DC 10 plus that spell's level). On a failes check, the spell fails.
