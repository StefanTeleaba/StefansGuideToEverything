***Flame Tongue.*** While holding this magic weapon, you can use a command word (no action required) to cause flames to engulf the damage-dealing part of the weapon. These flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet. While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you issue the command again or until you drop, stow, or sheathe the weapon.
