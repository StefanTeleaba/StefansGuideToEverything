a spiderkissed weapon, the target
must succeed on a DC 13 Refl ex save
or become entangled for 5 rounds as a
mass of webbing covers its body. The
webbing cannot be removed and lasts
for the duration of the effect. Bows,
crossbows, and slings with this property
bestow the spiderkissed property upon
their ammunition.
