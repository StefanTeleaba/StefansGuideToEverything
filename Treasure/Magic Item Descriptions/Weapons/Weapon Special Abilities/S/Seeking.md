***Seeking.*** When you make an attack with this weapon, you do not make an attack roll. Choose one creature you can see. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring Three-Quarters Cover and Half Cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage.
