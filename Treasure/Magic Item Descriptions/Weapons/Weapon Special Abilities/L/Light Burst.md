***Light Burst.*** 
A light burst weapon explodes with dazzling
light upon striking a successful
critical hit. The light does not affect you
(in case you have light sensitivity, light
blindness, or some other vulnerability
to light). The target of your critical hit
is dazzled for 5 rounds. If it has a weakness
to light, it suffers the effects of its
weakness for 1 round as if it was in the
presence of a daylight spell, and is dazzled
for 5 rounds afterward. For example, if
you wield a light burst weapon and score
a critical hit against a drow, the drow is
blinded for 1 round, and then dazzled for
5 rounds as normal. Projectile weapons
bestow the light burst property upon
their ammunition.
