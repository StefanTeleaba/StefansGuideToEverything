***Domineering.*** When you hit a creature with this weapon, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
