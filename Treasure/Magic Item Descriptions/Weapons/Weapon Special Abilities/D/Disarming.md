***Disarming.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn with this weapon, you can replace one of the attacks with an attempt to disarm the target. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + PB + STR/DEX) or drop one object of your choice that it's holding, with the object landing in its space. You can't be disarmed of this weapon unless you have the Incapacitated condition.
