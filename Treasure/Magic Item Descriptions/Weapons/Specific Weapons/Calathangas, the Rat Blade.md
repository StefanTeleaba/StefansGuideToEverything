*Weapon (Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

***Curse of the Rat.*** If a Humanoid touches or is hit by this sword, it is subjected to the following effect.  
*Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 11.  
*Failure:* The target is cursed. If the cursed target drops to 0 Hit Points, it instead becomes a Wererat under the DM's control and has 10 Hit Points.  
*Success:* The target is immune to this wererat's curse for 24 hours.  

This sword has 10 charges.  
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks to expend a number of charges for the following effects.  
2 charges: Summon a Swarm of Rats  
3 charges: Summon a Giant Rat as with the Summon Beast spell (Land only, level 3 version)  
The creatures are allies to you and your allies. In combat, the creatures share your Initiative count, but take their turns immediately after yours. They obey your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, they take the Dodge action and use their movement to avoid danger.
