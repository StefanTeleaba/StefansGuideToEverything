# Chitinous Shortbow
*Weapon (Shortbow), Rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Sting.*** As a Bonus Action, which you take immediately after you hit a target with an attack using this weapon, you can cause the target to take an additional 2d10 Poison damage. The weapon can't be used this way again until the next dawn.  

*Attuned to:*   
***Giant Scorpion.*** As a Magic action, you can throw this shortbow so that it lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, causing the shortbow to become a Giant Scorpion in that space. The scorpion is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours.

On your turn, you can mentally command the scorpion (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the Incapacitated condition. You decide what action the scorpion takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the scorpion defends itself.

As a Bonus Action, you can command the scorpion to revert to shortbow form in its current space, and you can't use the shortbow's property again for 1 hour. If the scorpion is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts to its shortbow form; the shortbow then shatters and is destroyed. If the scorpion reverts to shortbow form before losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.
