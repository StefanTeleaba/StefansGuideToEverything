Khazid'hea, a.k.a. Cutter: +2 keen adamantine longsword; AL CN; Int 17, Wis 10, Cha 17; Telepathy (Khazid'hea appears to lack the ability to speak or read); 120 ft. darkvision and hearing; Ego score 17.

Lesser Powers: Khazid'hea grants its wielder free use of the Cleave, Great Cleave, and Improved Sunder feats.

Special Purpose: Defeat/slay all (other than the item and wielder).

Dedicated Power: Cause rage in wielder as wizard spell.

Personality: Taken from Dantrag Baenre, a drow battle master, Khazid'hea has little personality of which to speak. The blade longs for little more than the chaos of battle and the blood of foes, and it constantly eggs its wielder into battle and is jealous of any kill for which it is not responsible. However, the blade makes little distinction between friend and foe and is likely to demand its wielder battle allies when all enemies have fallen. The blade grants its wielder the benefits of rage only if the wielder agrees to kill all "foes" or the blade is dominant. If Khazid'hea is dominated by its wielder, it alter its pommel to better suit the aesthetic tastes of its new master.
