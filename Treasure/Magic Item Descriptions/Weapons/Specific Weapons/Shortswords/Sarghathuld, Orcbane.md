**Lore:**  
Sarghathuld was forged in the Year of
Many Serpents (605 DR) by the dwar.
N\!l:I Master Smith Fyrfar Smokebeard.
The High Old One Turbaern, the Blood
~'A.x<:i of Clangeddin, then enchanted the
sworcl with the aid of the human
wizard Beldossan the Short (who was
rumored to· have dwarven blood) and
~lerathla "Rull>ytresses" llnatar, an elf
sorceress of Ylraphon. This group
toileo to produce more than a thousand
"orcslayer" blades over a handful of
years at the behest of the dwarf lord
· Tufr Stonebeard, who sougbt to
destroy the Vastar of the ores and
" begin his own kingdom. Sarghathuld
was ·given to the warrior Ulnorn, blood
of Jalabar, who wielded it with great
valor in the battles that saw the
·dwarves of the Vast shatter the rule of
-the ore chieftain Grimmerfang and
found Roldilar, the Realm of Glittering
"< ~~ ,t Swords:
~~ ., Ulnorn is known to have traveled to
'. -r-~ ~- fabled Myth Drannor, and it is believed
~§ t ··fthat Sarghathuld had further enchant-
- ·ments bound into it by dwarven craftsmen
and elven mages of the City of
Songs. With the fall of Myth Drannor
to the Army of Darkness in the Year
of Doom (714 DR), Sarghathuld disappeared
for nigh on twenty winters
before it was given by the lronlord of
Earthfast, Barundar mac ldrin, as a gift
to the young King Halanter I of lmpiltur
on his coronation. King Halanter was
the first monarch of lmpiltur to forge a
pact with the dwarves of Earthfast and
is still known to them as Arausamman,
the "Qreat Friend:' The blade remained
in the Royal Vaults until it came into the
possession of the archmage Soargar as
Old lmpiltur splintered apart.
Sarghathuld reappeared some 150
winters after King lmbrar's ill-fated
expedition into the Giantspires when
the warrior Kesten "Steelglance"
Orfhalin brought it to the sage
Athylmas of Saerloon for identification.
Kesten was the leader of the Grimblades
adventuring band, a group said
to have plundered many a ruin in the
Inner Sea lands east of the Vast. He
and his comrades are known to have
perished a scant three seasons later
beneath the talons of the venerable
green dragon Urnalithorgathla, who had
her lair in the dim and treacherous
depths of the Spiderhaunt Wood.
Sarghathuld and the bones of the
Grimblades lay for over ninety winters
amidst the piled treasures of this
mighty dragon until she was slain by
dwarves under the leadership of Borlin,
blood of Ghellin. Axe of rhe Iron House.
Borlin wielded Sarghathuld in battle
thereafter, and he is known to have
whelmed a large band of dwarven warriors,
the Mithril Legion, in the hope of
reclaiming the long lost Mines of
Tethyamar. Borlin and his army marched
north and west out of Tilverton in the
Year of the Wave (1364 DR) and disappeared.
Borlin is thought to have sent
word via magic to King Ghellin of the
Iron House that his expedition had succ;:
eeded in reclaiming some of lost
Tethyamar, but this is only rumor and
conjecture. When the mystery of Borlin
and the Mithril Legion is unraveled, it is
likely that the blade Sarghathuld will be
claimed once again.

Sarghathuld is a +1 short sword of dull gray metal, known to sages as "orcslayer" metal. On one side of the blade. the word "Sarghathuld" is etched in dethek runes, and "Orcbane" can be found on the other face. Embedded in the pommel is a glowing stone.

Sarghathuld's touch is deadly to orcs, half-orcs, and other orc-kin. When the blade is used against any such creature,
it is treated as a +3 bane short sword
vs. ores that inflicts +2d6 points of
bonus damage.
The final powers of Sarghathuld come
from the glowing stone in its pommel.
The stone constantly emits light equal
to a daylight spell. This light negates
and dispels any darkness effect.
Covering the pommel with an opaque
container blocks the light.
The wielder of Sarghathuld can
also release a beam of power from the
stone as a full-round .action. This beam
is a ray up to go feet long that inflicts
6d6 points of damage to any creature
it touches if the wielder makes a successful
ranged touch attack. The
wielder can will the stone to continually
attack the same target with the ray for
up to 3 rounds at a time, but doing so
prevents the wielder from using the
beam power for 3 rounds following this
extended use of the power. Use in this
manner does not require three separate
ranged touch attacks, but the beam can
be broken if the target manages to find
half cover or better within the 3 round
period. The ray inflicts full damage ro
objects.
It is unknown what effect the
removal of the stone from Sarghathuld
would have, but sages agree that the
stone's nature makes it likely that both
the gem and the blade would lose all of
their powers if this was even
attempted.
