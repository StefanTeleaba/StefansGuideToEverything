# Axe of Grounding
*Weapon (Battleaxe), Legendary*

The axe of grounding is a highly regarded magic item that was crafted long ago by the clerics of Moradin and duplicated few times since.
This axe has a short, thick haft and a broad, double-bladed head. Like most weapons crafted by dwarves, the design is heavy, durable, and elegant. The color of the metal is a dark blue shade of steel, the handle is often adorned with emeralds and rubies, the length of the haft is etched with runes in the dwarven native tongue, and intricate scrollwork is carved into both sides of the head of the blade.
The axe of grounding is a +2 shock dwarven waraxe. Each round, the axe absorbs the first 10 points of electrical damage the wielder would otherwise take. In addition, for one hour after the axe of grounding has absorbed electrical damage, it functions as a +2 shocking burst dwarven waraxe.
