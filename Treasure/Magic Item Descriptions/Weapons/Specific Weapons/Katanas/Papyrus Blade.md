# Papyrus Blade
*Weapon (Katana), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Keen.*** The number you need to roll on the d20 to score a Critical Hit on attacks rolls with this weapon decreases by 1.  
***Flaming.*** This weapon deals an additional die of Fire damage on a Hit.  
***Defending.*** The first time you attack with the weapon on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the weapon's bonus to your Armor Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.  
***Cleave.*** If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.
