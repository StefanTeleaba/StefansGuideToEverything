*Curse of the Azure Bonds v2*  

The Blade of Lathander is a magical
broad sword of incredible power, forged
by a renowned dwarven smith in the
fires of the morning sun itself, in the
Temple of Lathander at Saerloon. It was
created for one purposeâ€”to slay the
spirit of Tyranthraxus, master of the
Pool of Radiance.
The sword is a broad sword +3 with a
blade of smoked ruby quartz, unbreakable
in normal combat. On its golden
pommel are the symbols of Lathander
and Tyranthraxus, the latter crossed out.
In normal combat, the sword functions
as a broad sword +3. In combat
with Tyranthraxus or those he has possessed,
the sword will glow a bright
pink. When it glows it is +6 to hit, and
inflicts 3-30 points of damage. Tyranthraxus
must make a saving throw versus
spells (at -6 for the body he
inhabits) or be forced to retreat to the
Pool of Radiance.
Unlike the Gauntlets of Moander and
the Helm of Dragons, the sword has no
other special powers. Since its forging,
it has never been used against Tyranthraxus,
though its existence is said to
have kept him in the North during his
peak of power. It was stolen from Saerloon
and the Temple of Lathander a hundred
years ago, and has bounced from
treasure vault to treasure vault for the
past hundred years. Two years ago it
was stolen from the Zhentarim by a halfling.
The Black Network recovered the
sword and sank the ship the thief was
escaping in. The Zhentarim have since
put out the rumor that the sword was lost
at sea, when in reality it is being kept by
Fzoul Chembryl in his tower.
