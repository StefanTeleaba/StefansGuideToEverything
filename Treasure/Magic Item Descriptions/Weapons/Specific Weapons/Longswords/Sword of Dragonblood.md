These swords revel in the opportunity to slay dragons. The more
dragons a sword of dragonblood slays, the more it aids its owner
in killing wyrms in the future.
Lore: Characters can gain the following pieces of information
about swords of dragonblood by making Knowledge (arcana)
checks.
DC 20: The fi rst swords of dragonblood date from the Year
of the Crown (1351 DR). They were created to fi ght the green
dragon Dretchroyaster (before he became a dracolich). The Merry
Marauders nearly killed him in battle using these swords and
their wizardry.
DC 25: The Merry Marauders slew a number of lesser dragons
as practice for their fi ght with Dretchroyaster, which in turn
strengthened the powers of the swords.
DC 30: Larkonlan, a wizard in the Cult of the Dragon’s
Sembia cell, created these swords in order to provide a weapon that
might scare Dretchroyaster into questioning his own mortality.
He hired the Merry Marauders, and their attack was a signifi cant
part of the reason the dragon agreed to become a dracolich.
Description: These swords appear to be made from fi ne steel
forged in Sembia. They each bear a number of small tally marks
at the bottom of the blade near the hilt.
Effect: The swords are typically +2 dragon bane longswords
(though they can be other types of weapons). In addition to those
enchantments, they have a special power in relation to dragons.
When the wielder of a sword of dragonblood slays a dragon with
the weapon for the fi rat time, he or she gains a +1 bonus on any
subsequent attack roll against a dragon once per day. For each
additional dragon slain by the sword, this daily bonus increases
by 1. The wielder can spend any or all of this bonus at any time
during a day, using all of it on a single attack roll or splitting it
up among two or more rolls. Only true dragons count for the
purpose of gaining this bonus—not half-dragons, drakes, dragon
turtles, or other draconic creatures.
The bonus resets at sunrise each day, if any points were spent
during the preceding 24 hours. If the weapon changes hands, the
new wielder gains no bonus until he or she kills a dragon with
the sword. Should the sword ever be separated from its wielder
for more than 24 hours, any bonus it has accrued is lost.
For example, Dreilin Thenzington, a member of the Merry
Marauders, possesses a sword of dragonblood. He has previously
slain six dragons with the blade. This means that on any given
day, Dreilin has 6 points that he can add to one or more of his
attack rolls against dragons. Should he slay more dragons in the
future, his daily bonus will increase.
Activation: Nothing is required to activate the sword other
than swinging it, but using the pool saved within requires a free
action.
