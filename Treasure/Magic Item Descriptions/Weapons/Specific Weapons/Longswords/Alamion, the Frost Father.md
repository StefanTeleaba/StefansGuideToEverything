# Alamion, the Frost Father
*Weapon (Longsword), Rare*

*Alamion's blade is slightly thinner than a typical longsword blade and has a fuller down the center. Acid-etched snowflake patterns are scattered along the length of the blade, most of them concentrated near the hilt. The hilt of the sword is made of bronze sandwiched between two pieces of ivory carved to show clouds unleashing winds and snow. The grip is covered with mother-of-pearl lashed securely into place with bronze wire. The pommel of the weapon is a solid bronze globe with the snowflake lozenge of Auril etched into the bottom.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Temperate.*** You are unharmed by temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.  
***Sentinel.*** Alamion changes in appearance from shining, etched steel to glowing, translucent ice when fire-using creatures (any creature that has a fire-based attack) are within 120 feet of it. Wherever the wielder goes, so long as she grips the weapon and is within 120 feet of a fire-using creature, she leaves frosted footprints.  
***Bane.*** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls against Aberrations, Elementals, Fey and Fiends with this weapon. This weapon deals an additional 2d6 damage on a Hit against Aberrations, Elementals, Fey and Fiends.

This longsword is part of a matched pair of weapons, the other being the short sword Malamion. 

*Alamion's blade is slightly thinner than a typical longsword blade and has a fuller down the center. Acid-etched snowflake patterns are scattered along the length of the blade, most of them concentrated near the hilt. The hilt of the sword is made of bronze sandwiched between two pieces of ivory carved to show clouds unleashing winds and snow. The grip is covered with mother-of-pearl lashed securely into place with bronze wire. The pommel of the weapon is a solid bronze globe with the snowflake lozenge of Auril etched into the bottom.*

Alamion is a +2 longsword bane against evil outsiders. The wielder is affected by an endure elements (fire) spell as if cast by an 8th-level wizard as long as the sword is held. The weapon has a detection power as well. Whenever a fire-using creature (any creature that has a fire-based attack) comes within 100 yards of the blade, Alamion changes in appearance from shining, etched steel to glowing, translucent ice. Wherever the wielder goes, so long as she grips the weapon and is within 100 yards of a fire-using creature, she leaves frosted footprints.

Caster Level: 8th;
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, locate creature, endure elements, caster must be good;
Market Price: 90,315 gp;

**Lore:**  
The full history of this blade and its brother has been well documented. Roughly two hundred years ago, a wizard from Shannath named Obren the Left-Handed was hired to make a pair of swords for the glory of Auril. Obren did so reluctantly, producing Alamion ("Frost Father") and Malamion ("Frost Baby") over a five-year period. After a dispute about Obren's fee, priests of Auril tried to take the sword from him by force. The outcome of the battle is unclear, but Obren's swords did not end up in the hands of Auril's faithful. Thirty years later, a warrior named Berdino in Procampur bragged that he had a blade that could kill demons with a single strike. Berdino was found dead on a beach two tendays later, the victim of many poisoned crossbow bolts.

The new owner of Alamion was a vain, egotistical thief called Pellas the Fair. Pellas had learned of Malamion accidentally fourteen years earlier and strongly desired Alamion when he learned of its existence. Pellas held onto the swords until he died at the hands of Garijon Renold, a paladin of Torm. Garijon found the blades invaluable in his battles against the fiery denizens of the outer planes, and the two swords were passed on for generations in his order, from paladin to paladin.

Heleban of Ithmong, a paladin of Tyr, was the last warrior known to have used the swords. His battles against slavers and pirates on the Sword Coast are believed to have brought him to an untimely end.
