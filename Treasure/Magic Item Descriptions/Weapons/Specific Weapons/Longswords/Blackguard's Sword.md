# Blackguard's Sword
*Weapon (Longsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

*Formerly wielded by one who forsook all ties of friendship and kindness, this sword is rife with deranged energies. It seems to transmit feelings of contentment when carving through bones.*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Unholy.*** This weapon deals an additional 1d8 Necrotic damage on a Hit.
