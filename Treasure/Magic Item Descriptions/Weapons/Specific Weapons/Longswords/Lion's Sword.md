# Lion's Sword
*Weapon (Longsword), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

*The state sword of Tethyr had a hilt of gold, carved into the shape of a lion. The body, rear legs and tail made up handle and pommel, with its forelegs and front paws forming the crossguard. The head of the lion had open jaws, with diamond-encrusted mithral teeth set into the groove of the blade, which extended from the gaping maw. Two rubies were inset within the lion's eyes.*

***Flame Tongue.*** While holding this magic weapon, you can use a command word (no action required) to cause flames to engulf the damage-dealing part of the weapon. These flames shed Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet. While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you issue the command again or until you drop, stow, or sheathe the weapon.
