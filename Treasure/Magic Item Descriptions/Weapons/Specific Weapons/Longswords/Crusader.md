***Sentinel.*** While Fiends or Undead are within 120 feet of the sword, it glows faintly and bestows upon you a +10 bonus to your Strength score.  
***Disintegrating Burst.*** On a Critical Hit against a Fiend or Undead, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 20). On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 Force damage.
