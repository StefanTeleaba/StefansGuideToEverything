**Lore:**  
Ellendrin is a blade of high renown that is mentioned repeatedly in the tales and legends of the human settlements of the Inner Sea. Its maker is unknown, although the priesthood of Tyr has claimed that their deity had a hand in its creation. The Weeping Blade has seen a bewildering array of wielders over the years, and its history is as rich and colorful as that of any nation in the region of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  

The Weeping Blade first came to the lands of Impiltur in the Year of the Reaching Hand (803 DR) when the paladin Mellethos, the "Old Lion of Tyr," gave if to King Nord of Old lmpiltur. King Nord had lost his elder brothers Essys and Araln when together they fought and banished an army of fiends led by the balor Ndulu at the Battle of Moaning Gorge (786 DR). It was for this valiant deed and many others that Mellethos deemed Nord worthy of wielding Ellendrin. King Nord kept Ellendrin at his side throughout his reign, but upon his death, his successor King Halanter II gave the Weeping Blade to his childhood companion, the knight Jondar Tallmane.  

Jondar wielded Ellendrin with honor for many years against such enemies as the orcs of the Earthfast Mountains and the pirates of the Inner Sea (who raided the inland settlements and coast of Impiltur without mercy during the reign of Halanter II). In his declining years, Jondar retired to the Abbey of Grimjaws, a fortified seminary of Tyr on the western shore of Bluefang Water. There he gave up the Blade and commanded that Ellendrin be borne by a different paladin of the Abbey every year. The sole duty of the chosen holy warrior would be to guard and protect the monarch of Impiltur from all evil and wrongdoing. This tradition continued as Jondar had commanded until the waning days of Old Impiltur, when the paladin Darbrett "Bloodspurs" Tallim was slain in the intrigues that preceded the fall of the realm. The archmage Soafgar pried the sword from Darbrett'5 dead hand and kept it safe until the time when the kingdom of Impiltur rose anew.  

After the disappearance of King Imbrar and his Royal Guard, Ellendrin was thought lost forever, but in the Year of the Behir (1342 DR), it was identified by the sage Othiiyr for the daring thief Gort of Tsurlagol. Gort was notorious prior to the Time of Troubles for his brazen larcenous activities, and he was known to have acted as a highly paid "retriever of lost items" during this time. The thief refused to sell Ellendrin to Othiiyr, stating obliquely that interests in the Moonsea had already contracted for the Blade, and that he was travelling there immediately. After departing Othiiyr's house, the rogue was never seen again, and neither was Ellendrin or any of the other booty Gort carried.  

Ellendrin is a +3 longsword forged of star metal and hilted with mithral in a slightly upward curving cross-piece. The hilt is wrapped with silver wire, and a large, cabochon-cut diamond (worth 5,000 gp) is embedded in the pommel. This longsword confers the benefits of a bless spell (as if cast by a 9th-level cleric), by touch, upon any creature chosen by the wielder. This power can be used three times each day.  

The Weeping Blade is so named because it constantly drips holy water along the length of its blade when unsheathed. Any creature struck in combat that is susceptible to holy water suffers an additional +2d4 points of damage from the sword. Creatures susceptible to holy water damage in adjacent areas (within 5 feet of the wielder's target) take 1 point of splash damage from the weapon. This damage cannot be regenerated and must be healed normally.
