Albruin is a powerful magic sword coated in silver, which makes it effective against undead and lycanthropes. It is intelligent, with a mischievous personality that may drag you on unplanned adventures. You are but the latest in a long and varied line of wielders who have ranged from Cormyr to Impiltur to the Moonsea, with many adventures along the way.

**History:** Albruin is believed to be the creation of the long-dead smith Surdee, who was famous in his day for the craftsmanship of his work that came out of the forges of ice-bound Glister, where he worked ore fresh from the mines above the city on the edge of the glacier. The blade itself evades questions about its origins: It has no markings or definite touches of workmanship that identify Albruin as the work of anyone in particular.

Albruin was held for decades in the royal house of Cormyr, kept as a family treasure but seldom (due to its alignment) borne by the kings of that land. It was stolen from the palace at Suzail in the Year of Daystars (1268 DR) by the thief Nypan (“Nipe”), a halfling who was soon arrested in Wheloon by soldiers of Cormyr and slain when he attempted to escape. Nipe did not have the blade when seized, and he did not reveal its whereabouts. It was rumored among the thieves of that place that Nypan sold it to a “gray trader” (fence) named Blusken Shult, who delivered the sword to a waiting buyer.

The blade’s whereabouts were uncertain until the Year of the Wandering Waves (1292 DR), when a lady of high birth in Selgaunt, one Shamur Karn (later Uskreven), found the blade left behind in her bedchamber by a visitor fleeing the city guard. He never returned, and Shamur sold it in the Year of the Talking Skull (1293 DR) before she disappeared. The sword was bought by a recruiter visiting the city of Selgaunt on matters of trade (gold for mercenaries) on behalf of Prince Thaum of Telflamm. With his army in tow, Thaum sailed across the Easting Reach and sacked the city of Sarshel with complete surprise. During the fighting, Thaum came to covet the blade Albruin, and so the prince had its bearer murdered in an ambush by his own men so that Thaum could seize it for his own.

After Thaum’s death, Albruin was acquired by Adjuz, one of Thaum’s warriors, who took it back to the Dalelands. He perished at the hands of brigands along the Moonsea Ride, but not before he had sought out the sage Elminster of Shadowdale to ascertain its powers.

After the death of Adjuz, the trail of the sword is hidden for some eight winters, but it is known to have been in the hands of the mercenary general Malakar on this visit to Zhentil Keep in the spring of the Year of the Broken Helm (1302 DR), and was identified by the sage Murail of Sarbreen when a mercenary warrior sought him out to learn the blade’s properties in that city in the Year of the Catacombs (1308 DR). Albruin has not been seen since, but Elminster is known to have observed that its plain appearance and ability to control many of its bearers has certainly contributed to this anonymity.

**Description:** Somewhat broader in blade than a classic longsword, Albruin gleams with the sheen of its silver coating. The blade is otherwise unremarkable, making its name known to would-be bearers only through telepathy.

**Activation:** Albruin is a +3 silvered longsword. It does not radiate light.

**Effect:** +3 silvered longsword; AL CN; Int 17, Wis 10, Cha 17; Speech (Common, Elven, Undercommon, thieves’ cant); telepathy; 120 ft. darkvision and hearing; Ego score 16. It sheds an eerie blue radiance equivalent to a light spell (bright illumination in a 20-foot radius, shadowy illumination in a 40-foot radius) when drawn.

**Lesser Powers:** Cure moderate wounds 3/day, neutralize poison 1/day (wielder only), read magic at will.

**Greater Power:** Invisibility purge (30 ft. range) 3/day.

**Personality:** Albruin has the heart of a scamp, eternally curious yet easily distracted and given to making mischief. Commissioned by a Dambrathan half-drow prince who fled the reach of Queen Ausitil for the Great Grey Land of Thar and sought a boon companion, the blade’s intended recipient never received the sword because Albruin induced a smith at Surdee’s forge to steal it away ere the prince arrived to claim his weapon.

Albruin has little interest in notoriety and seeks only wielders who take it to a steady stream of interesting locales. Although not heroic by nature, the sword enjoys the immediate accolades of heroism, and is thus much more likely to prefer a good-aligned wielder to an evil one. Albruin is most likely to exert the strength of its personality when a mysterious ruin is in the offing, yet its wielders seem inclined to seek adventure elsewhere.

**Aura/Caster Level:** Moderate evocation. CL 9th.
**Construction:** Craft Magic Arms and Armor, cure moderate wounds, invisibility purge, neutralize poison, read magic, 25,030 gp, 1,970 XP, 50 days.
**Weight:** 4 lb.
**Price:** 49,565 gp.

Abruin is a broad sword made of steel alloyed with electrum (itself a natural alloy) and silver. This alloy is demonstrably as effective as silver against undead and other creatures who suffer particular effects from contact with silver. It lends a +1 bonus to its wielderțs attack rolls and a +3 bonus to its damage rolls. It sheds an eerie blue radiance in up to a 10-foot-diameter sphere when drawn from its scabbard. It is an intelligent weapon of chaotic neutral alignment with an Intelligence of 17 and an Ego of 13. It communicates by speech and knows common, elvish, drow, and thieves' cant. It can also read languages and magical writings.

Albruin's bearer can, at will, activate and maintain by concentration the sword's power to detect invisible objects in a 10-foot radius. Albruin can also neutralize poison once every three days, and heal its bearer once every 12 days. These powers are evoked at the will of the bearer, or by the sword if the bearer is unconscious and Albruin deems it advantageous to itself to activate either power. Physical contact between Albruin and the flesh of the bearer is necessary for the powers to work, but the sword need not be drawn to neutralize poison or heal.

Albruin is believed to be the creation of the long-dead smith Surdee, who was famous in his day for the craftsmanship of his work that came out of the forges of ice-bound Glister, where he worked ore fresh from the mines above the city on the edge of the glacier. The blade itself evades questions as to its origins. There are no markings or definite touches of workmanship that identify Albruin as the work of anyone in particular.

Albruin was held for many decades by the royal house of Cormyr, kept as a family treasure but seldom (due to its alignment) borne by the kings of that land. It was stolen form the palace at Suzail some 100 winters ago by the thief Nypan ("Nipe"), a halfling who was soon arrested at Wheloon by soldiers of Cormyr and slain when he attempted escape. Nipe did not have the blade when seized, and did not reveal its whereabouts. It was rumored among the thieves of Wheloon that he had sold it to a gray trader (fence) by the name of Blusken Shult, who had a merchant barge on the Wyvernwater, and that Blusken had sailed from Wheloon up to somewhere on the northern shore of the Wyvemwater, and delivered the sword to a waiting buyer.

The blade's whereabouts were uncertain for some 24 winters, until a lady of high birth in Selgaunt, one Shamur, found the blade left behind in her bedchamber by a visitor fleeing the city guard. He never returned, and Shamur sold it when she married. It was bought by an adventurer visiting the city of Selgaunt on matters of trade (gold for mercenaries) and wielded thereafter in several minor skirmishes about the Easting Reach before its owner died in an ambush. His slayer, the adventurer-prince Thaum of Telflamm, used Albruin to help take the lands of Impiltur forcibly from his father's rule and found his own kingdom. Thaum eventually died by magic (hired by his father Kuskur, who was unable to regain control of the lost lands militarily), and thus Albruin was acquired by one of Thaums warriors, who fled the dead king's keep and took the blade back westward, into the Dalelands.

This warrior, one Adjuz by name, perished at the hands of brigands on a northern road, and Albruin disappeared from view but not before Adjuz had sought out a sage (Elminster) in Shadowdale to learn the blade's true nature and powers. After the death of Adjuz, the trail of the sword remained hidden for some eight winters. It is known to have been in the hands of the mercenary general Malakar on his visit to Zhentil Keep in the spring of the ninth year thereafter, and it was identified again by the sage Murail of Sarbreen when a mercenary warrior sought him out in Ravens Bluff to learn the blade's properties some six winters beyond that time. (Sarbreen is now more commonly known as Ravens Bluff.)

We now know that Albruin came into the possession of the banelich Stallac Benadi in Zhentil Keep. When Stallac recruited Malakar to help him in his subterranean feud with Chrinson of the Blazing Sun, he offered the mercenary Albruin plus a fair amount of gold and gems. Malakar agreed and has held Albruin until now. (It was Malakar who traveled to Ravens Bluff to have Murail identify the blade so that he could better use it.)
