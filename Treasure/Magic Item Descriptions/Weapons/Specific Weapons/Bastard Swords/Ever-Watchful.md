# Ever-Watchful, Vindicator
*Weapon (Bastard Sword), Legendary*

*Ever Watchful was the mighty bastard sword that Helm preferred to wield two-handed. The sword had the symbol of Helm, a watchful eye with a blue pupil emblazoned on an upright gauntlet, on its hilt. It glowed with silvery flame, and anyone unworthy of wielding it felt a burning sensation when they grasped it.*
