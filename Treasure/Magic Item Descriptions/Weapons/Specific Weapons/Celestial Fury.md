# Celestial Fury
*Weapon (Katana), Artifact (Requires Attunement)*

*A weapon of superb craftsmanship, Celestial Fury had a flexible yet unbreakable blade that was honed to razor sharpness. Its hilt was wrapped in leather, granting it a comfortable grip, and a large pearl was mounted in the jaws of a dragon's head on the pommel. The blade shone a pale violet hue and snapped with electricity whenever drawn. Inscribed on the blade were magical characters meaning "celestial fury". The katana's sheath was made from the hide of a dragon with slate-gray scales that flashed incessantly in hues of blue, silver, and violet.*
