Carved from an unknown creamy-white wood resembling ivory, this unique weapon has been in the possession of Travis Deepdell for over thirty years, despite the efforts of Elaith Craulnober and others to steal it. No sages have been able to identify the bow’s origin, and legend lore spells only produce the beautiful illusion of an elf maiden’s face that cryptically asks the bearer to “take care of the Horn of Moon’s Dawning.” Some rangers and druids who gaze at the bow see a faint carved outline of a unicorn’s head along its outer curve, suggesting the weapon is connected in some way to Mielikki or Lurue.  
The bow of Hosark is a beautiful +2 distance mighty composite longbow (+5 Str bonus). When the bow is held or worn over the back, it acts as an amulet of proof against detection and location. Two times per day, the wielder can add the brilliant energy special ability to any arrow shot from the bow (so long as the total arrow bonus, including the brilliant energy special ability, does not exceed +10).
