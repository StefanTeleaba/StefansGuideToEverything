# Carrion War Pick
*Weapon (War Pick), Uncommon*

*The hooded man remained hunched over in the dark. Beneath him rest a body, now still, and in his hand he clutched a sickly weapon. Red ichor dripped from its pointed end. Guards accosted the man before long, which turned violent of course. One after another, more bodies were added to the pile, and weapon's point remained glistening and crimson. The man remained perched there, like the vulture he was, hungering for more.*

When you hit a creature with this weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d10 Necrotic damage to the target if it's missing any of its Hit Points. Furthermore, when you reduce a Small or larger enemy to 0 Hit Points with this weapon, you gain 1d10 Temporary Hit Points.
