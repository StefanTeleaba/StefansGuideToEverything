# Poison Soaked Kukri
*Weapon, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

You can take a Bonus Action to magically coat the blade of this Dagger with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 Poison damage and have the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. This Bonus Action can't be used again this way until the next dawn.
