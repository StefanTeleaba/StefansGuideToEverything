**Lore:**
Malagar was crafted in the Year of Rampaging Raaserpents (699 DR) to commemorate the slaying of the great red wyrm Malagarthaul "Flaming Claws" by King Amarkos II of Impiltur and a host of mounted archers. Malagarthaul had awoken from centuries of slumber in his Earthfast Mountains lair and swooped down upon the hamlets of Greentrail and Karvan's Oak, north and east of Lyrabar, seeking prey to assuage his raging hunger. King Amarkos and his men rode swiftly out of the Impilturian capital to face the dragon and bring him down.  

Enchanted by a cabal of mages led by the Mage Royal Ranerth Bentash, Malagar was wielded proudly by several kings and princes of the realm as a symbol of the might and battle prowess of Old Impiltur. It is thought that when the kingdom began to disintegrate, Soargar whisked the blade away by means of his Art from its place of honor within the Hall of Kings in the now-destroyed royal palace of Blackrock Castle, west of Hlammach.  

In the years after King Imbrar's disastrous foray into the Giantspire Mountains, many expeditions were sent into that region by the rulers of Impiltur to solve the mystery of Imbrar's disappearance. In the Year of the Blade (1275 DR), the mercenary captain Delros Parander and his band of hireswords, the Gauntlet of Doom, were commissioned by the aged King Lashilmbrar of lmpiltur to explore the area around Redfang Peak in the southern Giantspires. Delros and his company never returned to lmpiltur but were recruited some ten winters later in Cormyr by King Salember "the Rebel Prince" to scour the. Western Marches of that realm and free it from the influence of the youAg Crown Prince Rhigaerd. The Gauntlet of Doom won great notoriety in a single short season as Delros, openly wielding the blade Malagar, led his mercenaries against the various nobles who supported the young prince.  

In the waning days of Salember's reign, Delros and the Gauntlet of Doom vanished from Cormyr's Western Marches as the canny mercenary realized that the steady stream of riches from the coffers of "the Rebel Prince" would soon come to an end. This small mercenary company is thought to have taken ship across the Dragonmere to Westgate, but there is no record of 1 their arrival at this port. However, it is known that the increasingly desperate Salember used the infamous Fire Knives to make an example of many of his disloyal, erst while supporters in the final days of his rule. The fate of Delros, the Gauntlet of Doom, and Malagar "the Burnfang," remains unknown, but the sage Elminster believes it will undoubtedly be reclaimed by some bra adventuring band in wir1ters to c0me

Malagar is a blade of strange composition, being the carved tooth of a red dragon affixed to a hilt of adamantine. The "Burnfang" is a +2 keen falchion, and while it is held unsheathed, the bearer receives all the benefits associated with wearing a ring of warmth.  

On a successful critieal hit, Malagar shows its true potential, as a creature struck by the blade must immediately make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 18). If the save is unsuccessful, the creature suffers a fiery bleeding wound, which transforms the target's blood into flame at the wound's location. Each round for 3 rounds after the critical hit damage is inflicted, the affected creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage as blood seeps from the wound, burning the target inside and out.  

Obviously, a creature must have blood for Malagar to affect it in this fashion. (Elementals, undead, oozes, and constructs are some examples of creatures that are immune, as are all tt l reatures immune or even resistant to fire damage.)
