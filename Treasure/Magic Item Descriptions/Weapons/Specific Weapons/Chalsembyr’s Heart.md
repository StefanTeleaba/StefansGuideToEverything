# Chalsembyr’s Heart
*Weapon (Greatsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

*Chalsembyr’s Heart is a greatsword masterfully crafted of cold iron with a lion motif throughout. The iron itself has been tinted in gold, and the point where the cross guard and the blade meet bears a raised head of a lion face-on on one side and in profile on the other. The cross guards themselves appear as lion’s paws, and the base of the hilt — which is wrapped in white leather bound in gold wire — holds one large brilliant-cut white diamond surrounded by five fiery yellow rectangular corundums. The words “Seek the High Seat Always” in Celestial are etched along both sides of the blade.*
