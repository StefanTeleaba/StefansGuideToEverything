This +1 dagger looks like a normal masterwork
dagger, but when it hits, three phantom blades briefl y
whirl into existence around the main blade, stabbing and slicing
the same target, then winking into nothingness again. A manyfang
dagger thus deals quadruple damage on each successful hit,
or quintuple damage on a critical hit.
