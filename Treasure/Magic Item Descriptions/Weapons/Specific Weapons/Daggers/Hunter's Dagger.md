# Hunter's Dagger
*Weapon (Dagger), Rare*

*Prey often thinks it has escaped the worst of the predator's bloodthirst and fury - but there are always further torments to be meted out.*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Rupturing.*** When you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or take 1d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels for 1 hour. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
