Custom-built to the Black Viper’s specifications by Hadrhune, making it a Shadow Magic item, this unique black +2 corrosive assassin’s dagger of venom has a curved blade and serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes. In addition, the dagger provides a +1 bonus to the DC of the Fortitude save forced by the death attack of an assassin.
