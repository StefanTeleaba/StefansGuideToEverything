Clerics of Corellon Larethian dedicate their lives to the protection of the elven people and their ancient culture. Those who prove themselves worthy champions of their faith sometimes receive a special blade dubbed the hand of the creator. This intricately designed punching dagger is fashioned from mithral. Its handle is covered with strands of dark blue leather strips, and its silvery blade is marked with tiny elven runes.  
The hand of the creator works as a +1 keen punching dagger that deals an extra 1d4 points of damage when wielded by an elf or half-elf When used by a character with elven blood, the hand of the creator bestows the Curse of the Creator on any creature without elven blood it strikes. The non-elf foe can make a DC 14 Will save to resist the curse. The Curse of the Creator surrounds the creature in a permanent faerie fire effect and causes the target to be permanently shaken. (A shaken creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.) The hand of the creator's wielder can remove the curse as a standard action. The spells break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, and wish can also remove the curse.
