# Applebane
*Weapon (Dagger), Uncommon*

*A small steel dagger with a shadowtop handle, Applebane was once owned by the halfling thief Peliwen Redgrass. Peliwen was a kind but morose individual who spent most of his time sitting in a large rocking chair that he took with him on adventures. Before important adventures, he would just sit in his rocking chair and eat apples with the aid of his dagger. Peliwen's blade was so rarely used for combat that his comrades starting calling it "Applebane".*
