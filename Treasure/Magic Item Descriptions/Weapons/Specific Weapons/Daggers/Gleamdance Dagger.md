# Gleamdance Dagger
*Weapon (Dagger), Rare*

*A pair of pixie wings were used to create this pretty blade - their delicate tracings can be seen all day and night, though they shine brightest by the light of a gibbous moon.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Glowing.*** You can cause the item to shed Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet, or extinguish the light (no action required).  
***Gleamdancer.*** While wielding this Dagger, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
