# Black Chimes
*Weapon (Flail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

*Black Chimes haft was a metal rod. Three heads were attached to it via thin black chains of iron; each was a hollow metal tube. When the flail was in someone's hands, its heads moved about as if in a breeze, clanking together like a wind chime. There was no way of muffling the chime sounds, not even by wrapping the weapon in padding.*
