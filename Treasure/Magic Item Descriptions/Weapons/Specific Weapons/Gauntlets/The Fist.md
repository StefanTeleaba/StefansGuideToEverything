*Magic of Faerun, p.142*

This adamantine chainmail gauntlet has pointed knuckles of solid metal. Forged long ago by dwarves (who don't like seeing it in nondwarven hands), it is a +2 spiked gauntlet (+l enhancement bonus from adamantine, +1 enhancement bonus from magic). The wielder of the gauntlet is protected from chill metal and heal metal spells. Once per day the wielder can declare a piledriver blow, which deals an additional +2d6 points of damage on a successful hit (if the attack misses, the piledriver blow is wasted for that day). A creature struck by the piledriver blow must make a Fortitude save (DC 22) or be stunned for ld4 rounds and a Reflex save (DC 22) to avoid being knocked prone.
