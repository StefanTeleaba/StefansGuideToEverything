*These elegant gauntlets are made of a silvery metal and have a scaly surface. Each finger is tipped with a long talon made of sapphire.*  

Provided that you are lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good, gauntlets of the talon grant you two primary natural claw attacks that count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Each claw deals 1d6 points of slashing damage (if you are Medium).  

**Relic Power:** If you have established the proper divine connection and already have levels in the monk class, you are treated as if you were a monk of five levels higher than you actually are for the purposes of AC, unarmed damage, and the ki strike ability. This benefit doesn’t stack with similar benefits (such as from a monk’s belt). Also, you can treat your unarmed damage as either bludgeoning or slashing damage (chosen each time you attack).  
To use the relic power, you must worship Bahamut and either sacrifice a 3rd-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 5 HD. If you sacrifi ce a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD, the gauntlets also function as ghost touch weapons for the purpose of attacking incorporeal creatures. In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on grapple checks.  
**Lore:** It is said that this silvery set of gauntlets was fashioned by Bahamut himself, then given to the master of a now-defunct order of monks (Knowledge [religion] DC 15).  
Members of the order’s inner circle eventually discovered the secret of their manufacture, but they managed to make only a few additional sets before their order was destroyed by followers of Tiamat (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).
