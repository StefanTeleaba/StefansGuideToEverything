# Bow of Songs
*Weapon (Shortbow), Rare*

*This bow is made of fine wood and appears to be of elven design.*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Elvencraft.*** This bow can be wielded as a Quarterstaff.  
***Sound Shot.*** When you miss with an attack roll, you can expend one Bardic Inspiration Die, roll that die, and add it to the attack roll, potentially causing the attack to hit. If the attack hits, add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll. If the attack still misses, the use of Bardic Inspiration isn't expended.
