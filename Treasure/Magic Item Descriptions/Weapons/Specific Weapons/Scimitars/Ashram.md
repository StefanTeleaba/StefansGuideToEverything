**Lore:**  
Ashram was forged more than two thousand years ago at the behest of priests of the war god Anhur for use by Senusret, champion of the armies of Mulhorand. Senusret wielded Ashram valiantly in the Orcgate Wars, and upon his death the blade passed to other war leaders of the God Kings. When Narfell launched a seaborne invasion of Mulhorand in the Year of the Clipped Wings (623 DR), Ashram fell into the hands of an unnamed Narfelli warrior who bore it north. Years later, the blade was buried with him in a barrow somewhere in the Great Dale.  

The blade next appeared in the "Grand Muster," a huge military inventory and catalogue ordered by the warlike King Thorodil of lmpiltur in the Year of the Sunless Passage (576 DR). The scimitar was noted as being borne by Duke Calthos of House OrbH, a minor noble possessed of a reputation for daring adventures and dark intrigues. House Orbil was declared outlaw some fifty winters afterward, and Ashram fell into the hands of the royal family of lmpiltur. It was seldom borne by the rulers of lmpiltur (due to an inability or unwillingness to master the nuances of wielding its curved blade) and languished for hundreds of years in the Royal Vaults until the Mage Royal Soargar brought it and many other swords to his tower in Lyrabar.  

Some sixty winters after Ashram was lost with King lmbrar in the Giantspires, the Red Wizard Sarros presented the sword to then Zulkir of Divination, Elzarr of the Crimson Eye. Sarros had led an expedition into the Giantspires to recover the fabled Watch Crystal of Alathas, one of the magic scrying stones discovered by llmara in ruined Myth Drannor that was subsequently carried and lost by King lmbrar and his Royal Guard. The Red Wizards are thought to have added enchantments to the scimitar at this time, and Ashram was subsequently given to the Biting Blade of Thay, Daryn Mellas. (The Biting Blade of Thay is the formal title used by the weapons tutor of the Hands, the elite agents of the Council of Zulkirs.)  

Ashram is now believed to be in the possession of Thoroun, a weapons master and one of the senior Hands who has held that rank for over thirty winters. Thoroun is known to be active in the Inner Sea region, coordinating the activities of the Hands and working against the Harpers at every opportunity. The last confirmed sighting of Thoroun, a stocky, much-scarred human in gray leathers, was in the town of Proskur, west of Cormyr in Uktar in the Year of the Tankard (1370 DR). After slaying a handful of local toughs in a tavern brawl, he was seen taking the east road out of town.  

Ashram is a +2 scimitar of bronze that exhibits the strength of the highest quality steel. Its guard is also made of bronze, and the weapon's grip is wrapped with strips of fire-lizard hide. The scimitar's pommel is a claw clutching a gem that flickers with a red flame that some sages postulate is a sliver of elemental fire.  

Ashram gives its user a +4 bonus to initiative while it is wielded in battle. (This bonus stacks with that provided by the Improved Initiative feat.) The wielder is made aware of this "quick-strike" ability through a slight tingling sensation that the weapon transmits to the hand that grasps it.  

The scimitar also holds a rare type of spirit that no sage has ever been able to identify. However, these scholars have managed to attribute certain powers of the item to this creature. Anyone struck by Ashram takes +1d6 points of bonus fire damage. In addition, whenever the wielder strikes with a successful critical hit, she can elect ro have the spirit of the blade release a stunning flaming burst attack. This attack deals an additional +1d10 points of bonus fire damage. Humanoids who survive this damage must then make a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC 16) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.  

The presence of the spirit renders Ashram immune to any damage from fire, heat, or electricity. Similarly, all physical attacks upon the scimitar do not harm it. If someone should discover a way to eject the spirit, another automatically returns and binds itself to Ashram after 24 hours have passed. During those 24 hours, Ashram loses all its special abilities and immunities and functions as a normal +2 scimitar.
