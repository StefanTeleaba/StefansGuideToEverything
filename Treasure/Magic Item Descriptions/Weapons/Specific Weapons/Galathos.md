***Silvered.*** When you score a Critical Hit with this weapon against a creature that is shape-shifted, the weapon deals one additional die of damage.
***Spell Turning.*** While holding this weapon, you have Advantage on saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no effect on you.
