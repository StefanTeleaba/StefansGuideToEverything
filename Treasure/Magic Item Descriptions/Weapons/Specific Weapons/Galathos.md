**Lore:**  
Galathos was forged sometime during the height of the ancient realm of Raumathar. The warrior Erbass of Raumathar claimed the blade in the final climactic battles that saw the mutual clestruction of that realm and Narfell, and he was seen fleeing west into the trackless depths of the Yuirwood.  

Erbass was never seen again, but Galathos reappeared many centuries later when the infamous pirate Urthag the Knife was forced to abandon the sword in the city of Tsurlagol, known then as Chessagol. Urthag had brazenly spent several hours of revelry in the Bloated Gargoyle Inn before the Royal Constabulary became aware of his identity and sought to apprehend him. In his hurried flight across the rooftops of Chessagol, Urthag and the blade were parted, and it was delivered to King Lamoth of that royal city-state.

King Lamoth of Chessagol was famous throughout the Sea of Fallen Stars for his gigantic family (he had some eight sons and six daughters) and his continual attempts to marry into the established royal bloodlines of the Inner Sea. Seeking to lend some legitimacy to his family's fledgling monarchical rule, Lamoth was always sending this son or that daughter to the royal courts of Cormyr, Westgate, or Milvarn in the hope that a suitable royal marriage could be arranged. Eventually, King Lamoth succeeded, marrying his daughter Elthia to Prince Bellodar of lmpiltur, who eventually became King Bellodar Ill in the Year of the Sifting Sands (642 DR).  

Galathos accompanied the Princess Elthia to Lyrabar as a part of her dowry, and in time it became the sword traditionally borne by the son and heir of the reigning monarch of Old lmpiltur. When the Crown Prince Amarkos succumbed to plague, Galathos was placed in the Royal Vaults to await a suitable heir to the throne. The disappearance of Princess Aliia two years later, however, saw Galathos retrieved by the archmage Soargar for safekeeping.  

Galathos remained lost for over two centuries until the warrior Graldor "One-Hand," leader of the adventuring band known as the Company of the Collar, ran afoul of the Red Wizard Kelnar the Etched and a host of his gnoll minions in Spearsmouth Dale. The people of Telflamm still talk of the morning that a weeping Graldor entered their city and proceeded to the great Tower of Tempus, temple to the Lord of Battles, cradling the corpse of the swordmaid Evlanna in his arms. There, Graldor handed over the blade Galathos as payment for a prayer that would see his love returned to life. Galathos remained in Telflamm until it was stolen-along with the fabled Red Book of War and other valuable items-by the local thieves' guild, known as the Shadowmasters, in the Year of the Arch (1353 DR). In the tumult that followed, the sword was erroneously thought recovered along wilh other temple treasures. It is known that the aged Taeron, Champion Rampant of T empus in Telflamm, continues to actively search for Galathos and has offered a reward of 15,000 pieces of gold for its recovery. Its whereabouts remain a mystery.  

Galathos is a +2 rapier made of a steel and silver alloy, demonstrably as effective as silver against creatures that suffer negative effects from contact with that metal. The blade has been treated with everbright, and its hilt is bound in soft blue leather. The sword sheds a bright silver radiance that provides illumination equivalent to a light spell when drawn from its scabbard.  

Arguably the most valuable of Galathos's abilities is that three times each day, the sword can reflect any hostile spells that target it or its wielder back upon the spellcaster (as the spell spell turning). This function is automatic and operates without the impetus of the weapon's wielder. Unused spell reflections cannot be "saved up" for later use.
