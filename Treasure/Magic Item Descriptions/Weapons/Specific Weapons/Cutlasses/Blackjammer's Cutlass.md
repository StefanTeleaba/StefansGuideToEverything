# Blackjammer's Cutlass
*Weapon (Cutlass), Very Rare*

*Although it was a heavy cutlass of ancient design, Blackjammer's cutlass was surprisingly light. The blade did not appear to be made of metal, save for the hilt, and its cutting edge was composed of a material resembling a dull, matte onyx. Its elaborate hilt was carved to resemble a keelhauled sailor.*
