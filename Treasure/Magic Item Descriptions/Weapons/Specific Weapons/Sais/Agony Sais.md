# Agony Sai
*Weapon (Sai), Rare*

*Agony Sais usually come in pairs. Both sais are identical, being crafted so the center blade resembles a serpent. Green leather covers the handle and the tines are fashioned to look like recoiling vipers, fangs bared.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Alchemical Silver.*** When you score a Critical Hit with this weapon against a creature that is shape-shifted, the weapon deals one additional die of damage.
***Impale.*** When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can leave the Sai buried in the target's flesh. The target can remove the Sai as an Action. While the Sai is buried in the target's flesh, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of its turn. Its Speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.
