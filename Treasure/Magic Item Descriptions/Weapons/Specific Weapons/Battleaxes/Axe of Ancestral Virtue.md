When you wield an axe of ancestral virtue, it functions as a +1 keen adamantine dwarven waraxe if you are lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good. Prized by the faithful of the Soul Forger, these weapons have long been used in the defense of dwarf holdings.

**Relic Power:** If you have established the proper divine connection, an axe of ancestral virtue reveals its intelligence and sentience (AL LN; Int 10, Wis 17, Cha 17; speech, telepathy, darkvision 120 ft., hearing; Ego score 17). In addition, the axe can use bless, cure moderate wounds (wielder only), and faerie fire, each three times per day.  
To use the relic power, you must worship Moradin and either sacrifice a 5th-level divine spell slot or have the True Believer feat and at least 9 HD. If you sacrifice a 7th-level divine slot (or have the True Believer feat and at least 13 HD), the weapon can also use haste (wielder only) three times per day.

**Lore:** Untold years ago, one of Moradin’s high priests volunteered to be bound into the original axe of ancestral virtue so that the weapon would have both intelligence and the virtuous nature to serve Moradin well. This priest’s personality has been duplicated into the few copies of the weapon that have been forged since. The weapon has never revealed the priest’s original name to any user, but judging from the fact that the axe constantly urges its wielder to attack the ancient enemies of the dwarves (goblinoids and giants), he must have been a fi erce warrior indeed. The weapon takes great delight in “illuminating targets” (faerie fi re), “salving honor-wounds” (cure moderate wounds), and granting “godspeed” (haste). The axe also judges its wielders on how well they adhere to traditional dwarf culture, and it rebels mightily against nondwarves who so much as pick it up (Knowledge [religion] DC 20).
