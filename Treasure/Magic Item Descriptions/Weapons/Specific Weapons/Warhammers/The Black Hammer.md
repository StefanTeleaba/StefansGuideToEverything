# The Black Hammer
*Weapon (Warhammer), Uncommon*

*The Black Hammer was an enchanted warhammer crafted out of a horn of an ancient black dragon. The hammer's head was made out of blackened bone. It was long and curved, ending with a sharp point on one end. The surface of the head was notched with many tiny line grooves burned by acid. The weapon's shaft was a thick and sturdy stick of iron-bound wood decorated with sharp iron spikes. The holy symbol of Bhaal was burned into the handle with acid.*
