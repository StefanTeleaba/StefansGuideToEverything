# Delzoun's Fist
*Weapon (Warhammer), Very Rare*

You gain a +5 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Throwing.*** This weapon gains the Thrown (Range 20/60) property. If it already has the Thrown property, its Range is doubled.

*Attuned to:*  
***Strength.*** You gain a +4 bonus to your Strength score while attuned to this weapon.  
***Returning.*** This weapon returns to the wielder's hand immediately after hitting or missing a target with a ranged attack.  
***Spell Turning.*** While wearing this ring, you have Advantage on saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no effect on you. If that spell targeted only you and didn't create an area of effect, you can take a Reaction to deflect the spell back at the spell's caster; the caster must make a saving throw against the spell using their own spell save DC.
