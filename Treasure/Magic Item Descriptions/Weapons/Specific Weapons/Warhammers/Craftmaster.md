*Weapon (Warhammer), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

You gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
***Impact.*** Your Critical Hit threshold with this weapon decreases by 1.  
***Throwing.*** This weapon gains the Thrown (Range 20/60) property. If it already has the Thrown property, its Range is doubled.

*Attuned to:*  
***Returning.*** This weapon returns to the wielder's hand immediately after hitting or missing a target with a ranged attack.  
***Seeking.*** When you make an attack with this weapon, you do not make an attack roll. Choose one creature you can see. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring Three-Quarters Cover and Half Cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage.
