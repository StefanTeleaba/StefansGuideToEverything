# Weapons

## Special Materials
To find the cost of a weapon made of an exotic material, multiply the regular weight of the weapon by the cost of one pound of the special material and add the cost of the regular weapon.

### Adamantine
*100 GP, 1 lb.*  
*Found only in meteorites and the rarest of veins in magical areas, this ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor.*

If a weapon made of Adamantine hits an object that isn't being worn or carried, the hit is a Critical Hit.

### Darkwood
*10 GP, 1 lb.*  
*This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light.*

A weapon made of Darkwood weighs only half as much as a normal weapon of that type.

### Mithral
*100 GP, 1 lb.*  
*Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor and is occasionally used for other items as well.*

A weapon made of Mithral weighs half as much as a normal weapon of that type and has the Finesse property.

### Platinum
*500 GP, 1 lb.*  
*Platinum is heavy silvery-white metal. It does not rust, and is resistant to tarnishing. It is often mined as a pure metal rather than as an ore. It is especially rare, and more valuable than gold.*

Platinum is primarily valued as a precious metal, used to mint coinage and as a sign of wealth and status.


## Masterwork
*A Masterwork item is a finely crafted version of a normal item.*

To find the cost of a Masterwork weapon, add 200 GP to the cost of the regular weapon.

You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with Masterwork weapons.


## Enchantment Bonus

A weapon needs to be of Masterwork quality before it can be enchanted.

Magic weapons can have an Enchantment Bonus ranging from +1 to +3.

To find the cost of adding an enchantment to a weapon, square the Enchantment Bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) of the weapon and multiply it by 2,000 GP.

## Special Ability

A weapon needs to have at least a +1 Enchantment Bonus before it can have a Special Ability.

A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +6.
