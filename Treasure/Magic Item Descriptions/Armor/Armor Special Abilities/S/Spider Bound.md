***Spider Bound.*** 
Once per day, you can speak a command
word to cause your shield to transform
into a fiendish spider. The spiderâ€™s size
depends on the type of shield, as shown
on the following table.
The spider follows your mental commands.
It remains for 10 rounds or until
reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it
instantly reverts back to a shield. While
the spider is activated, you lose your
shield bonus to AC.
