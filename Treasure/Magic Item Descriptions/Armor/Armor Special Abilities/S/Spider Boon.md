***Spider Boon.*** 
Spider boon armor allows you
to navigate through the sticky
strands of webbing. You gain a +4
enhancement bonus on Climb and
Escape Artist checks. Also, the webs
of monstrous spiders or spiderkin (such
as ettercaps) cannot affect you.
Three times per day, you
can increase the enhancement
bonus on Climb
checks to +8 and gain a climb
speed equal to your base land
speed. When under this effect,
you can take 10 on Climb checks even
if rushed or threatened. This function
lasts for 8 rounds.
