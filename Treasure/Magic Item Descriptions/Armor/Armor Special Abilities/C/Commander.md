*Magic Item Compendium, p.9*  
A suit of armor or shield that has this
property always appears brilliant and
gleaming, even in fi lthy or squalid conditions,
though it doesn’t shed any useful
light. Attempts to paint over or obscure its
fi nish do not diminish its brightness.
While wearing commander armor or
carrying a commander shield, you gain
a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy
checks, and each ally within 30 feet of
you (not including yourself) gains a +1
morale bonus on Will saves. However, the
shiny fi nish makes you so noticeable that
you also take a –5 penalty on Hide checks
(in addition to the normal armor check
penalty).
Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and
Armor, eagle’s splendor.
