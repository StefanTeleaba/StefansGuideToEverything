***Fearsome.*** 
Fearsome armor functions as if it has
armor spikes (PH 124) if the armor
doesnâ€™t have this feature already. In addition,
when wearing this armor, you gain
a +5 enhancement bonus on Intimidate
checks, and you can demoralize opponents
(PH 76) as a move action instead
of a standard action.
