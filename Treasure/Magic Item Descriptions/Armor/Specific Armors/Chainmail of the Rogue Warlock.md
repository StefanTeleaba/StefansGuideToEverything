# Chainmail of the Rogue Warlock
*Heavy Armor (Chain Mail), Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

*20 lb.*

*This extremely light chain mail is made of very fine mithral links coated in black glass that seem to absorb light rather than reflect it. A warlock named Igantius created this chainmail in order to be able to go forward in life without his patron being able to follow. Only when he had attained a great age that Ignatius finally took off the Chainmail and gave it to his son, finally fulfilling his contract and giving up his soul.*
