**Lore:**  
Hellshield was crafted by the wizard Armadane for the paladin Cornelius Borugon, a devout follower of Heironeous who dedicated his life to the destruction of fiends. Cornelius was slain by the blade of a beautiful assassin in the service of a demon lord; while he readily saw the evils of the demonic and diabolic races, he often turned a blind eye to the evil members of his own race.
