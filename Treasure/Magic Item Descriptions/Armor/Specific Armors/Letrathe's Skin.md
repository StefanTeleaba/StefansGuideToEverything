*Letrathe's Skin is a suit of Plate Armor crafted of red dragon scales. It is particularly unusual because of the huge diamond set in the breastplate. Letrathe cut the diamond to resemble a dragon's scale, and the gem acts as the repository for the armor's primary ability.*

You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.  
***Magic Jar.*** While wearing this armor, you can cast Magic Jar with it (save DC 18), using the diamond in the breastplate as the material component for the spell. The armor can't cast this spell again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.  
***Fire Ward.*** Whenever you take Fire damage, the armor absorbs the damage instead, up to a total of 120 HP. If you have any Resistances or Vulnerabilities, apply them before deducting from the buffer. If the damage reduces the buffer to 0 Hit Points, you take any remaining damage. Recharging the pool of Hit Points requires the wearer to immerse the armor in the blood of a freshly slain red dragon over the course of a Long Rest.

**Lore:**
In his younger days, when he spent less time protecting his hoard. Nightcandle ventured both near and far in various guises. Notably, he spent much time with the ogre mage witch Delathe. The product of their liaison was a daughter, whom the world came to know as Letrathe. Nightcandle eventually grew tired of Delathe and slew her in Letrathe's fifteenth year. He then seized the ogre mage's wealth to add to his own. Finding his daughter to be an amusement, he brought her back to his lair and spent the next few seasons tutoring her in the arcane arts.  
Letrathe learned her lessons well and left before her father tired of her as he did her mother. She made her way wasily in the world by using her natural inclination toward magic, shapeshifting, and brutality. Her time spent with Nightcandle awakened more than her magical abilities; it kindled both a burning lust for wealth and an intense hatred of herself and her father. More than anything, Letrathe wanted to be a dragon, not just a half-breed, and it was through a suit of magic armor that she thought she could achieve her goal. This drove her to gather a select group of mercenaries to assist her.  
Letrathe adopted the persona of an elven adventurer and wandered for several years before she fell in with Adoc the Voiceless, a thief and extortionist of some repute. She preferred the quiet man to the ranger Gryr, who delighted in laying humanoids of all types, particularly ogres. The half-dragon and her hirelings slaughtered a trio of young red dragons who still laired together for mutual protection. From their hides, she created a suit of dragon scale armor that encased her from head to toe. She incorporated a single flat diamond into the scales of the breastplate and used magic to craft armor to suit her. Gryr dubbed the armor "Letrathe's skin".  
Letrathe wore the armor in the attack. She entered Nightcandle's lair in gaseous form and struck while the dragon was befuddled with the bard's music. Resuming her true form, she confronted her father. The armor allowed her to withstand Nightcandle's fiery breath, and she used the diamond's power to make good her dream of being a dragon while her father was distracted by his other attackers. Unfortunately, Nightcandle's will was stronger than Letrathe's, and he forced her spirit back into the diamond. He destroyed her body before she could return to it, so she perished with her own creation.  
Letrathe's skin is a suit of +1 full plate crafted of red dragon scales. It magically grows or shrinks to fit any Large, Medium-size, or Small wearer. It is particularly unusual because of the huge diamond (worth approximately 5,000 gp) set in the breastplate. Letrathe cut the diamond to resemble a dragon's scale, and the gem acts as the repository for the armor's primary ability.  
Once per week, on command, the wearer of Letrathe's skin can attempt to magic jar as a 10th-level sorcerer using the diamond as the receptacle for her soul. In addition, the armor can absorb up to 120 points of fire damage, after which the wearer suffers normally from fire-based attacks. Recharging this power requires the wearer to immerse the armor from twilight to dawn in the blood of  a freshly slain red dragon.
