# Horseshoes of Crushing Blows
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a Magic action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, it gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with its hooves.
