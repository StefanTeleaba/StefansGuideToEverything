# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Amber Monkeys
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

*The three monkeys in this figurine are carved from amber, all stacked up in a column. The top monkey has its hands over its eyes, the middle monkey has its hands over its ears, and the bottom monkey has its hands over its mouth. Each monkey wears a leering expression that would be amusing if it wasn’t so sinister.*  
*A mad wizard driven into exile in the Feywild carved the first amber monkeys in his jungle stronghold. Known for his wild simian slaves, he used them to wreak havoc on the enemies haunting his domain. Legend holds he bound the spirits of his most loyal servants into the figurine so that he could call upon them whenever he needed.*

***Amber Monkeys.*** These amber statuettes of monkeys are always created in sets of three. You can use one figurine or all three simultaneously. Each can become a Small Ape for up to 1 hour. Once a monkey has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. The monkeys can use a Bonus Action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space they can see. The monkeys have Advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the menkey's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the Incapacitated condition.

**Monkey of Blinding.** You can command the monkey to teleport on the shoulders of a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Blinded condition. The target can take an Action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Blinded.

**Monkey of Deafening.** You can command the monkey to teleport on the shoulders of a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Deafened condition. The target can take an Action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer Deafened.

**Monkey of Muting.** You can command the monkey to teleport on the shoulders of a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be gagged. While gagged, the creature can't speak or cast spells with a Verbal component. The target can take an Action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer gagged.
