# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Moonstone Rabbit
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

***Moonstone Rabbit.*** This statuette can become a Rabbit for up to 1 hour. The rabbit has a Burrow Speed of 60 feet and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake. It also has Tremorsense with a range of 60 feet. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. The rabbit can also burrow through solid rock but once it has done so three times, the statuette loses all its properties.
