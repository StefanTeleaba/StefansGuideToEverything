# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Blue Quartz Eagle
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

***Blue Quartz Eagle.*** This polished blue quartz eagle can become an Eagle for up to 24 hours. The eagle fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed. The eagle has Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, it can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across. The eagle can communicate telepathically with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.
