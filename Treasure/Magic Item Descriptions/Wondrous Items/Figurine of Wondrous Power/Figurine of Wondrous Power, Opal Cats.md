# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Opal Cats
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

***Opal Cats.*** There are three of these figurines, two kittens and a mother cat. Each cat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

**Mother Cat.** This 1-inch-tall black opal figurine can become a Large shimmering black panther with the same statistics as a Lion. It has 8 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in panther form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until the next dawn, when it regains all expended charges.

**Kitten of Caterwauling.** This half-inch-tall fire opal figurine can become a scruffy kitten with orange-yellow fur with the same statistics as a Cat for up to 1 hour. As an Action, the cat can start to emit a piercing wail. Each creature in a 120-foot-Cone originating from the cat makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 Thunder damage and has the Deafened and Stunned conditions until the start of your next turn. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Kitten of Contemplation.** This half-inch-tall white opal figurine can become a fluffy white kitten, apparently only a few weeks old with the same statistics as a Cat for up to 8 hour. The kitten immediately sits on the lap of its activator and begins purring. Due to the soothing and hypnotic nature of the kitten's purr, a Wizard in contact with the kitten can replace two spells when using their Memorize Spell feature. The kitten's purr also makes the activator Immune to the Confusion spell. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
