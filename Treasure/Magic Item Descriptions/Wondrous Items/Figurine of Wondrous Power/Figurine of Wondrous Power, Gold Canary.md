# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Gold Canary
*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

***Giant Canary Form.*** The figurine becomes a giant canary for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

***Gold Dragon Form.*** While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) for up to 1 hour. The dragon can't use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can't be used this way again until 1 year has passed.
