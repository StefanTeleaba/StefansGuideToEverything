# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Electrum Serpent
*Wondrous Item, Rare*

A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if you take a Magic action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

*The delicate electrum serpent frequently dangles from a thin chain so that it can be worn about the neck, but a few include pins to serve as pendants as well. Additionally, others might be standard 2-inch tall statuettes.*  
*The electrum serpent is a strange figurine in that it seems to contain two creatures in one. One command summons forth a fearsome snake that streaks across the battlefield and sinks foot-long fangs into its foes. A second command summons a transparent serpent with milk-white scales that slithers and coils around its master or ally to bestow new life and vigor. Neither serpent ever appears at the same time, though some legends claim the serpents would turn upon each other if they both did appear at once.*  
*The silvery statuette features tiny jade slivers as its eyes, a color it retains when you conjure the creature housed within it.*

***Electrum Serpent.*** This statuette functions differently depending on which form you summon. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in either of the two snake forms costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges.

**Metallic Serpent.** The figurine becomes a Giant Constrictor Snake.

**Transparent Serpent.** The figurine becomes a Small snake with the same statistics as a Giant Venomous Snake. As a Bonus Action, the snake can touch another creature and expend one of the statuette's charges to cast Cure Wounds using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability.
