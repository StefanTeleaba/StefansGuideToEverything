# Spring Rain
*Shield (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)*

*This kite shield was forged entirely from adamantine save for the outer rim of riveted silver. Touched by the work and sacrifice of his friend, a hero now long-fallen shed tears on the shield and claimed it was rain. The hero's tears now adorn the face of the shield cristalized in the form of small pear-shaped diamonds as if raindrops running down the shield.*

***Adamantine.*** While holding this shield, any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit.  
***Beacon.*** You can cause the item to shed Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet, or extinguish the light (no action required).  
***Guardian.*** The item warns you, granting a +2 bonus to your Initiative rolls if you don't have the Incapacitated condition.  
***Unbreakable.*** The item can't be broken. Special means must be used to destroy it.  
***Adamantine Protection.*** When you're hit by an attack while you're holding this shield, any Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing damage dealt to you by that attack is reduced by 5.  

***Protective Field.*** As a Reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the Emanation can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation damage anything outside it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.  
***Projected Shield.*** As a Reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll or targeted by the Magic Missile spell, you can use the Shield to create an imperceptible barrier of magical force around the target. Until the start of your next turn, the target has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and they take no damage from Magic Missile. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.  

*Attuned to:*  
***Charisma.*** You gain a +2 bonus to your Charisma score while attuned to this shield.  
***Holy Aura.*** You emit an aura in a 10-foot Emanation. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition. While in the aura, creatures of your choice have Advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have Disadvantage on attack rolls against them.  
***Missile Attraction.*** Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.  
***Protection.*** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.  
***Regenerate.*** At the start of each of your turns while you're holding this shield, you regain 1 Hit Point if you are Bloodied and have at least 1 Hit Point.  
***Spells.*** You always have the listed spells prepared. You can cast each one once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spells using any spell slots you have.
